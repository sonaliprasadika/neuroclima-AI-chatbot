This approach is part of a broader effort to transition to a low-carbon society, with a target to achieve net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. Key components of Norway's strategy include: 1. **Financial Support Schemes**: The government provides financial incentives to municipalities and counties to implement projects that reduce emissions. This encourages local initiatives that align with national goals. 2. **Investment in Renewable Energy**: Norway is focusing on increasing the use of renewable energy sources, which can help decrease reliance on fossil fuels in both the agricultural sector and transportation.",148,0.0002782402],["What is the role of CO2 taxes in Norway's climate strategy?","Norway introduced CO2 taxes on mineral oil, petrol, and emissions from petroleum extraction in 1991. The government plans to increase these taxes to 2,000 NOK per tonne of CO2-equivalent by 2030 as part of its broader strategy to reduce emissions under the European Union's Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR).","CO2 taxes play a significant role in Norway's climate strategy as a key instrument for incentivizing emissions reductions across various sectors. The government aims to increase these taxes on emissions under the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) to 2,000 NOK by 2030. This increase is intended to encourage both individuals and businesses to reduce their carbon footprint by making carbon-intensive activities more costly, thereby promoting investments in cleaner technologies and practices.  The revenue generated from CO2 taxes can also support financial initiatives aimed at promoting emissions reduction projects at the local level, such as those in municipalities and counties.",120,0.0002221334],["How is Norway addressing emissions from the waste sector?","Norway has regulations for extracting landfill gas from all landfills with biodegradable waste. Furthermore, landfilling of easily degradable organic waste was prohibited starting in 2002, and the practice was further extended to all biodegradable waste in 2009.","orway is addressing emissions from the waste sector through a financial support scheme aimed at promoting emissions reduction projects within municipalities and counties. This initiative is part of a broader government strategy to meet its climate commitments for 2030, focusing on reducing emissions at the local level and facilitating the transition to a low-carbon society. By supporting projects that target emissions from waste management and processing, the government aims to develop practical knowledge and strategies that can lead to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.",95,0.0002575618]]}
