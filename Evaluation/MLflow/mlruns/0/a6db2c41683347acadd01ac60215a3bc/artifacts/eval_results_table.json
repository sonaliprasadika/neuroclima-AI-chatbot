{"columns":["inputs","ground_truth","outputs","token_count"],"data":[["How does useEffect() work?","The useEffect() hook tells React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed (we\u2019ll refer to it as our \u201ceffect\u201d), and call it later after performing the DOM updates.","The `useEffect()` hook in React allows you to perform side effects in function components, such as fetching data, directly interacting with the DOM, or setting up subscriptions. It takes two arguments: a function that contains the code for the side effect and an optional dependency array that specifies when the effect should run \u2014 either after every render or only when specific values change.",73],["What does the static keyword in a function mean?","Static members belongs to the class, rather than a specific instance. This means that only one instance of a static member exists, even if you create multiple objects of the class, or if you don't create any. It will be shared by all objects.","The static keyword in a function restricts the visibility of the function to the file in which it is defined, preventing it from being accessed from other files. Additionally, if used for a local variable inside a function, it allows the variable to retain its value between function calls.",55],["What does the 'finally' block in Python do?","'Finally' defines a block of code to run when the try... except...else block is final. The finally block will be executed no matter if the try block raises an error or not.","The 'finally' block in Python is used to define a section of code that will be executed regardless of whether an exception was raised or not in the preceding 'try' and 'except' blocks. It is often used for cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing resources, ensuring that these actions occur even if an error interrupts the program flow.",70],["What is the difference between multiprocessing and multithreading?","Multithreading refers to the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads concurrently, where each thread runs a process. Whereas multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to run multiple processors in parallel, where each processor can run one or more threads.","Multiprocessing involves using multiple processes, each with its own memory space, to execute tasks simultaneously, which can leverage multiple CPU cores effectively. In contrast, multithreading uses multiple threads within a single process, sharing the same memory space, which can lead to easier communication but may result in issues like race conditions.",62]]}
