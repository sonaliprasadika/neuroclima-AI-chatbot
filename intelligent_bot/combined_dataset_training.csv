United Kingdom,"The UK resubmitted its 2020 NDC target in 2022. Its latest NDC, however, provides more detail on additional information that improves transparency around the UK's decarbonization plans.
The UK's NDC covers all sectors and gases. For CO2, CH4 and N2O the reference year is 1990 and for F-gases the reference year is 1995. The UK’s overall absolute target is to reduce GHG emissions at least by 68% (including LULUCF) by 2030 compared with reference levels. Emissions from International Aviation and Shipping are not included.
The UK has a policy framework in force establishing the binding commitment of net zero emissions by 2050, and Scotland sets bolder goals to reach net-zero in 2045 and 75% below 1990 by 2030. Wales pledges at least 80% reduction by 2050. 
The Climate Change Act introduced carbon budgets for the UK Government, which cap emissions over successive five-year periods and must be set 12 years in advance.
The UK government is putting into force the Clean Growth Strategy, which is a Ten Point Plan for a green industrial revolution, encompassing clean energy, buildings, transport and technologies. Moreover, the government pushes for individual plans across key sectors such as Energy White Paper, Transport Decarbonisation Plan and Heat and Buildings Strategy (UK NDC, 2020).
UK’s NDC establishes a reduction of 68% of 1990 levels including LULUCF emissions. If LULUCF is excluded, this is equivalent to 69% or 251 MtCO2e. CAT classifies this as strong target and once the UK adopts national policies (2030 ban on the sale of fossil fuel cars and a ramping up of renewable energy investment, particularly into offshore wind) it will bring their emissions in line with the 1.5°C goal. Also, the UK has a net-zero goal by 2050. CAT cannot rate, at this moment, the UK target due to complexities derived from Brexit (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).

he Climate Settlement is officially known as “Recommendation of the Energy and Environment Committee: Climate Settlement, Innst. 390 S (2011-2012), based on the White Paper on Climate Efforts, Meld. St. 21 (2011-2012)”. This document reinforces the targets set out in the 2008 agreement on climate policy on transportation; construction; agriculture and carbon uptake by forests; and mainland industry and petroleum activities. Some of the core measures the document recommends to be adopted within these areas include:
• Create a climate and energy fund for development of technology and industrial transformation;
• Increase the offshore supply of electric power from the mainland, while safeguarding biological diversity;
• Increase state subsidies for investment in, and operation of, municipal public transportation and other environmentally-friendly forms of transportation;
• Adopt climate measures in agriculture and carbon removals in forests through active forest management;
• Maintain or increase the forest carbon stock through active, sustainable forest policies;
• Improve incentives for the use of bio-energy derived from wood (with emphasis on forest residues);
• Increase the mandatory sale of bio-fuels to 5%;
• Tighten the energy requirements in the building code to passive house level in 2015 and nearly zero energy level in 2020.
The settlement includes three main targets:
• In relation to the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, Norway plans to exceed its commitment by 10%
• Norway plans to become carbon neutral by 2050. However, if an ambitious global climate agreement is entered into through which other industrialised countries commit to undertake large reductions in GHG emissions, Norway will bring forward this target to 2030
• By 2020 Norway plans to commit to reducing its GHG emissions to an equivalent of 30% of the 1990 emissions level (and up to 40% contingent on global action)
While emissions reductions can be carried out in Norway or abroad, the paper states that Norway will have a domestic reduction goal of two-thirds of GHG emissions."

Norway,"The Green Shipping Programme (GSP) is a public-private partnership working to reduce barriers for the introduction of low and zero emission solutions within the maritime sector. The program has initiated 28 green pilot projects since its beginning in 2015, and completed 8 of them. Since 2019, the programme has had a special focus on fleet renewal within the short shipping segments."
Norway,The national risk loan scheme for short sea shipping and fisheries will contribute to a more climate and environmentally friendly short sea shipping and fishing fleet by providing loans for investments in low and zero emission vessels.
Norway,Established with the aim of fomenting fleet renewal in a segment with little ability or incentives for green fleet renewal.
Norway,Financial support scheme dedicated to projects in county councils aiming at reducing emissions for high speed passenger vessels.
Norway,"Directed towards development of zero emission solutions for large ships sailing long distances. Funding will go to projects that will achieve new knowledge 
and develop new technologies and solutions, suitable for vessel segments and sailing distances which do not already have available zero emission solutions."
Norway,"1) Investment in railway infrastructure in the larger capital area, the so called InterCity-project. 2) Investment in specific infrastructure measures for freight transport."
Norway,"To improve conditions for rail freight operators, and to facilitate a shift from road to rail."
Norway,The Ministry of Climate and Environment entered into an agreement with the processing industry that was not covered by the EU ETS.
Norway,The purpose of this compensation scheme is to prevent carbon leakage from Europe resulting from increased electricity prices due to the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).
Norway,The producers have voluntarily replaced some of the coal consumption with bio carbon
Norway,The producers have voluntarily installed abatement technology
Norway,The major aluminium producers signed an agreement with the Ministry of Climate and Environment to reduce emissions per tonne of aluminium produced. Emphasis on reducing the anode effect frequency and time.
Norway,Agreement between the Ministry of Climate and Environment and the business organisations representing most users of gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) and the single producer.
Norway,Implementation of the revised EU regulation No. 517/2014 and the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol.
Norway,Several support schemes that differ between regions. No-autumn tillage implemented in 2003 will be strengthened in 2023. Environmentally friendly spreading of manure implemented in 2012. Emission reductions through environmentally friendly spreading of manure and spreading of manure in the growing season instead of in autumn.
Norway,Keeping livestock on pasture may help abate emissions from manure management compared to keeping animal in confinement. Various requirements and support schemes differentiated between livestock category and pasture category.
Norway,"Several support schemes, of which storage of manure is mostly targeted to climate mitigation"
Norway,"National support scheme. As a side-effect, better drainage may also reduce GHG emissions."
Norway,Project to develop and maintain tools to quantify green house gas emissions from farms
Norway,"Develop knowledge which, among others, will contribute to reduced emissions on farm level"
Norway,Support scheme for delivery of manure. The goal is to increase the utilization of livestock manure to biogas production.
Norway,Avoid conversion of peatland into cropland (agriculture effect).
Norway,Increase the number of plants to an optimum level from a climate perspective to enhance net carbon sequestration
Norway,A grant scheme was  launched to support plant breeding. Genetically improvement means to single out robust plants which can improve growth and quality.
Norway,Fertilization can sustain or improve carbon sequestration where nitrogen scarcity in existing forest areas limits plant growth.
Norway,Planting trees on new areas to increase the carbon uptake
Norway,Tending of young stands is to select the most adapted tree species and optimize growth.
Norway,Treating stumbs after harvest to reduce the spread of tree rot to increase growth.
Norway,Regeneration with the tree species that gives the highest growth
Norway,Regulate the minimum harvesting age
Norway,Avoid conversion of peatland into cropland (LULUCF effect).
Norway,All landfills with biodegradable waste must have a system for extracting landfill gas
Norway,From 2002 landfilling of easy degradable organic waste was prohibited. This prohibition was replaced by the wider prohibition of depositing from 2009 that applies to all biodegradable waste
Norway,Agreements primarily to ensure that waste is collected and sent to approved treatment. Waste regulations for a number of waste fractions and a tax on beverage packaging. Tax on incineration up to 2010 and for landfills up to 2015.
Norway,"Includes consideration of low- and zero emission  requirements in public procurement for ferries and high speed vessels. Further includes consideration of low- and zero emission requirements for aquaculture industry and for offshore vessels in the petroleum industry. Lastly, it includes the proposed increased support  to Enova (PaM #9) as presented in the Støre Government climate status and plan of October 2022."
Norway,"CO2 taxes on mineral oil, petrol and emissions from petroleum extraction on the continental shelf were introduced in 1991. The effect of the current level of the taxes on emissions under the ESR is covered by #1. In the Støre Government's climate status and plan, it is stated that the government aims to increase the taxes on emissions under the ESR to 2 000 2020-NOK in 2030. This increase towards 2030 is covered by this PaM."
Norway,"The 2018 Climate Agreement for Agriculture sets out a target of reduced emissions and increased removals in agriculture of 5 million tonnes CO2-eq for the period 2021-2030. The target also includes contributions from buildings, transportation and land-use caused by the sector."
Norway,"Consists of 1) from January 1st 2023, the requirement is that 17 % of total fuel sold to road traffic is biofuel, with a sub requirement that 12,5 % should be A or B listed biofuel, 2) from January 1st 2023, the requirement is that 10 % of total off-road diesel sold is biofuel (A- or B-list) and 3) introduction of biofuel requirement for domestic shipping and fisheries from July 1st 2023 (."
