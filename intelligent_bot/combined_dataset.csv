The National Energy Plan aims to install other sources of energy to achieve a diversification of the basket and ensure a reliable energy supply. The inclusion of wind power plants, photovoltaic solar generation, geothermal energy and generation from the biomass in the country's electric mix is ??sought.
The UPME (Unit of Energy Mining Planning - Unidad de PlaneaciÛn Minero EnergÈtica) identified the possible medium and long-term expansion alternatives that would allow the basket to diversify and have evaluated its impact on the system in the Expansion Reference-Generation and Transmission Plan 2014-2028. Several scenarios were presented. One of the scenarios considers the participation of more than 10% in non-conventional renewable energy in installed capacity by 2028, with a generation that ranges from 2.5% to 7.5% of total production in the period of analysis.
In the most feasible scenario, unconventional sources of energy may account for 6% of the electric energy basket, which would correspond to an installed capacity of 1,207 MW in 2028. In addition to the 474 MW of wind power in the pessimistic scenario, it is considered possible to install 143 MW of solar energy, 275 geothermal and 314 MW of biomass cogeneration.

Main objective of the Algerian Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Development Plan is to expand usage of renewable energies and to diversify energy sources in the country.
Goals:
To install 22 000 MW of power generating capacity from renewable sources between 2011 and 2030 (of which 12 000 for internal usage and 10 000 MW for export);
To meet 20% of electricity generation from renewables by 2030
Renewable energy development will drive sustainable economic development of the country, increase energy security supply in Algeria and will have job-creation factor;
Solar energy (both solar PV and solar thermal) is recognized by the Algerian government as a primary renewable technology to be developed. The potential for wind, biomass, geothermal and hydropower energies is comparatively very small.
Combined, Algeria hopes to have more than 22 GW of renewable energy capacity installed by 2030, and has targeted the connection of 4.5 GW by 2020. Should Algeria hit its target, renewable energy would by 2030 account for 27% of the nationís power outpout, offsetting the need for 22 GW of natural gas generation.

The new renewable energy law establishes more ambitious national renewable energy targets that should reach 20% of total national energy consumption and 40% of total electricity consumption by 2020. Moreover, 20% of energy used in heating and cooling and 10% of energy used in transportation have to come from renewable sources. The new legislation foresees the creation of a Special Renewable Energy Investment Service that will act as an interface between public institutions and investors, annually assess the main challenges to renewable energy deployment and manage the support funding allocation process. Existing remuneration of individual residents in areas where renewable energy projects are running have been amended and replaced by a credit on electricity bills. In fact, the law establishes that a share of the RE concession taxes paid by RE producers to regional and local authorities will will be allocated to local households as a credit on their electricity bill as a way to share the benefits of living nearby a renewable energy generation plant. The renewable energy generation licensing process has also been very much fasten and eased by the regulation that entitles the Regulatory Authority for Energy (RAE) with the assessment and issuance of licences, under the authority of the ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change. The whole licensing process can not last over a 30-month period. Moreover, absolute priority is given to RES projects combined with desalination plants, when and only when the RES project is on an island and its capacity does not exceed 25% of the capacity of the desalination plant. The law also tackles the grid infrastructure challenge and implements a timely limited target for the grid utility to connect non-interconnected islands to the main grid. Still, RE projects are not granted grid priority access as grid connection will be established on a first-come first served basis until the network is saturated. The grid utility is compelled to provide grid access within four months after the connection demand has been released.

The UKís overall absolute target is to reduce GHG emissions at least by 68% (including LULUCF) by 2030 compared with reference levels. Emissions from International Aviation and Shipping are not included.
The UK has a policy framework in force establishing the binding commitment of net zero emissions by 2050, and Scotland sets†bolder goals to reach net-zero in 2045 and 75% below 1990 by 2030. Wales pledges at least 80% reduction by 2050.†
The Climate Change Act introduced carbon budgets for the UK Government, which cap emissions over successive five-year periods and must be set 12 years in advance.
The UK government is putting into force the Clean Growth Strategy, which is a Ten Point Plan for a green industrial revolution, encompassing clean energy, buildings, transport and technologies. Moreover, the government pushes for individual plans across key sectors such as Energy White Paper, Transport Decarbonisation Plan and Heat and Buildings Strategy (UK NDC, 2020).
UKís NDC establishes a reduction of 68% of 1990 levels including LULUCF emissions. If LULUCF is excluded, this is equivalent to 69% or 251 MtCO2e. CAT classifies this as strong target and once the UK adopts national policies (2030 ban on the sale of fossil fuel cars and a ramping up of renewable energy investment, particularly into offshore wind) it will bring their emissions in line with the 1.5∞C goal. Also, the UK has a net-zero goal by 2050. CAT cannot rate, at this moment, the UK target due to complexities derived from Brexit (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).

The policy instruments overarch all the sectors and mitigation areas. Special attention to fuel switch and investment in renewables in electricity, transport and industry sectors. Also, codes and standards for a less demand and more material efficiency are the base for the building sector, but also present in electricity and transport. Additionally, biomass is incited as a fuel rather than fossils in the industry and agriculture sector (Dominican Republic NDC, 2020).
The main policy instruments are possible to cite the economic strategic planning (Plan DECCC-2011 and Ley-1-12) and the Climate Change National policy (Decree 269-15 ñ PNCC 2015). Also, in the transport sector it is planned to set codes and standards to reduce GHG emissions (e.g. resource efficiency area ñ new lines, new modals, low carbon tech and electric cars). In the electricity sector the efforts are to increase the share of renewables (wind, solar and PCH) and fuel switch to a less intensive. In the building sector, Dominican Republic wants to improve energy efficiency (codes and standards visioning more efficiency) and resource efficiency to reduce the demand of energy, set new standards to introduce efficient lighting for public and residential areas. In addition, in the industry sector standards will be set for the acquisition of industrial electric motors and in biomass to replace fossil fuel.† Reforestation is also envisioned by the country.

The roadmap seeks to realize a hydrogen-based society on a step-by-step basis under the following three-phase program, carefully considering both short and long periods of time required to overcome technological challenges and secure economic efficiency:
(i) Phase 1: Dramatic expansion of hydrogen use (from present). By expanding the use of fixed fuel cells and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) dramatically, Japan will capture the global market for hydrogen and fuel cells in which it leads the world.
(ii) Phase 2: Full-fledged introduction of hydrogen power generation and establishment of a large-scale hydrogen supply system (by the second half of the 2020s). While increasing hydrogen demand further, Japan will increase the scope of current hydrogen sources to cover unused energy sources and establish a new secondary energy structure including hydrogen in addition to traditional electricity and heat.
(iii) Phase 3: Establishment of a CO2-free hydrogen supply system on a total basis (by around 2040). Japan will combine hydrogen production with CCS or use hydrogen from renewable energy to establish a totally CO2-free hydrogen supply system."

The ETS will start with the electricity sector covering around 3.5 Gt CO2 emissions (Stavins, 2017) and is expected to start in 2020 (China Carbon Forum, 2017). After that, gradually other industry sectors, such as cement, steel, petroleum refining and chemicals will be added to the program. The ETS targets is not an absolute emissions gap, but a rate based (CO2/Kwh) cap that is set per category per sector. The rate is based on historical trends and technology benchmarks (Stavins, 2017). For example, coal-fired power plants are expected to have different rates, than gas-fired power plants. In the beginning, the permits of this scheme will be grandfathered to the firms, in this case plants emitting more than 26,000 tonnes of CO2 per year (Carbon Brief, 2017)."

 1. Direct access for new, totally rebuilt, reactivated or repowered/upgraded plants with a capacity not exceeding a given limit (art. 4, paragraph 3) and using specific types of sources or for special projects;
2. Enrolment into the Registries for new, totally rebuilt, reactivated or repowered/upgraded and renovated plants
3. Awarding of incentives after participation in a competitive Dutch auctions (electronic auctions held by GSE) for new, totally rebuilt, reactivated or repowered/upgraded plants: the capacity of these plants shall exceed a given threshold (5 MW).
To determine the way of access to the incentives for renovated plants, the capacity to be considered corresponds to the increase in capacity obtained as a result of the project.
The total maximum new installed capacity that could be awarded to all technologies through both registries and auctions is 1.370 MW of which 800 MW for new onshore wind capacity.
Between the communication of the registration and the entry into operation the maximum time gap limit depends of the plant technology.

European Union,"(Regulation No. 517/2014 on fluorinated greenhouse gases and repealing Regulation (EC) No 842/2006)
The objective of this Regulation is to protect the environment by reducing emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases. Accordingly, this Regulation:
(a) establishes rules on containment, use, recovery and destruction of fluorinated greenhouse gases, and on related ancillary measures;
(b) imposes conditions on the placing on the market of specific products and equipment that contain, or whose functioning relies upon, fluorinated greenhouse gases;
(c) imposes conditions on specific uses of fluorinated greenhouse gases; and
(d) establishes quantitative limits for the placing on the market of hydrofluorocarbons.
Non-CO2 emissions, including fluorinated greenhouse gases but excluding non-CO2 emissions from agriculture, should be reduced by 72 % to 73 % by 2030 and by 70 % to 78 % by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. If based on the reference year 2005, a reduction in non-CO2 emissions, except those from agriculture, of 60 % to 61 % by 2030 is required. Fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions were estimated at 90 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2 equivalent in 2005.
The Commission report of 26 September 2011 on the application, effects and adequacy of Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) concluded that the current containment measures, if fully applied, have the potential to reduce emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases. Those measures should therefore be maintained and clarified on the basis of the experience gained in implementing them
The use of sulphur hexafluoride in magnesium die-casting and in the recycling of magnesium die-casting alloys shall be prohibited. The use of sulphur hexafluoride to fill vehicle tyres shall be prohibited. From 1 January 2020, the use of fluorinated greenhouse gases, with a global warming potential of 2 500 or more, to service or maintain refrigeration equipment with a charge size of 40 tonnes of CO2 equivalent or more, shall be prohibited. Quotas for placing hydrofluorocarbons on the market shall be allocated among the different producers, and transfers will be allowed.

Czechia,"The Czech government adopted a national climate change plan comprising both mitigation and adaptation measures in 2004.
The plan seeks to improve energy efficiency and cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by developing renewable energy and expanding nuclear power capacity. The plan aims to cut energy consumption per unit of GDP by 3-5% per year. It also aims at increasing the share of renewable energy to 16% by 2030, and transport fuel from alternative sources such as gas or biofuels to 20% by 2020. The plan contains data on the greenhouse gas emissions in the Czech Republic, including projections of future development, and presents proposals for concrete measures to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and for adaptation measures. The programme was reviewed in 2007, and the review adopted by the government in April 2008. The review pointed to significant increase in the use of renewable energy sources, as well as progress in the agriculture and water management sectors. However, it found the Czech Republics energy intensity and GHG emissions per capita were comparatively high, and that transport sector emissions continued to increase. The National Climate Change Plan is thus being reviewed to emphasise measures targeting the industry and transport sectors, which contribute the most to GHG emissions, as well as to take into account the evolution of domestic, European and global political negotiations on climate change since 2004.

The policy targets a 30% share of coal in the countryís energy mix, which we assume refers to the power mix. While the government has handed out 36 coal mining licences tied to 10,000 MW of coal capacity, none of the projects have been successful (Daily Trust, 2019).

Canada,"Aims to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025.
These outcome-focused regulations apply to upstream oil and gas facilities, which are responsible for extraction, production, processing and transportation of crude oil and natural gas. The requirements target two key methane sources: fugitive emissions, which are unintentional leaks from equipment leaks, and venting emissions, which are intentional releases of methane into the air.
General requirements apply to all covered upstream oil and gas facilities:
Compressors: As of January 1, 2020, covered compressors will be required to take action to conserve or destroy methane, or else to meet applicable vent limits. If a company opts not to conserve or destroy methane, it must demonstrate compliance with the limits via an annual measurement or continuous monitoring. Corrective action is required if those emissions exceed the limit applicable to the compressor, which depends on the installation date, the type of compressor, and its rated brake power.
Well completions involving hydraulic fracturing: As of January 1, 2020, these sites must conserve or destroy gas in most circumstances instead of venting it into the air.
Conditional requirements apply to covered upstream oil and gas facilities handling significant volumes (at least 60,000 cubic metres/year of gas):
Fugitive equipment leaks: As of January 1, 2020, upstream oil and gas facilities are required to start implementation of leak detection and repair program consisting of three comprehensive inspections per year at most upstream oil and gas facilities. Corrective action is required if leaks are discovered.
Facility production venting: As of January 1, 2023, upstream oil and gas facilities must limit annual facility vented volumes of methane to 15,000 m3. These facilities would need to capture the gas and either use it onsite, re-inject it underground, send it to a sales pipeline, or route it to a destruction device. This requirement does not apply to vented gas from:
-specific temporary activities such as emergencies, liquids unloading, or equipment start-ups, shutdowns, and blowdowns;
-facilities that have vented less than 40,000 m3 in the past year without destroying or selling or re-injecting any gas; and
-processing equipment such as glycol dehydrators, compressors and pneumatic devices.
Pneumatic devices:
-Controllers: As of January 1, 2023, facilities using natural-gas-powered pneumatic controllers must ensure that on-going emissions remain below 0.17m≥ per hour.
-Pumps: As of January 1, 2023, pneumatic pumps are prohibited from emitting methane where the volume of liquid being pumped exceeds 20 litres per day.

The program encompasses various legislative amendments aimed at achieving these goals. Here's a breakdown:
Amendment to the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG 2023):
Aims to increase the share of renewable energies in gross electricity consumption to at least 80% by 2030.
Incorporates measures such as expanding wind and solar power by 80% by 2030, promoting electricity storage and power plants using green hydrogen, increasing remuneration for solar systems, facilitating the establishment of citizen energy companies, enhancing financial participation of municipalities in wind energy, and eliminating levies for electricity self-supply.

Amendment to the Onshore Wind Energy Act (WaLG):
Regulates area targets for designating wind energy areas, aiming for 1.4% of the federal area by the end of 2027 and 2% by the end of 2032.
Amendment to the Federal Nature Conservation Act (BNatSchG):
Aims to streamline the approval process for wind turbines while maintaining high environmental standards.
Recognizes wind turbine operation as being in the public interest, facilitating exemptions.
Simplifies the assessment of species protection exceptions and alternatives, particularly for repowering onshore wind turbines.
Amendment of the Building Energy Act (GEG):
Introduces mandatory requirements for installing climate-friendly heating systems in new homes, with at least 65% powered by renewable energy starting January 2024.
Allows existing heating systems to continue use with transition periods and exemptions.
Provides social compensation payments and a KfW subsidy program.

United Kingdom,"The UK resubmitted its 2020 NDC target in 2022. Its latest NDC, however, provides more detail on additional information that improves transparency around the UK's decarbonization plans.
The UK's NDC covers all sectors and gases. For CO2, CH4 and N2O the reference year is 1990 and for F-gases the reference year is 1995. The UKís overall absolute target is to reduce GHG emissions at least by 68% (including LULUCF) by 2030 compared with reference levels. Emissions from International Aviation and Shipping are not included.
The UK has a policy framework in force establishing the binding commitment of net zero emissions by 2050, and Scotland sets†bolder goals to reach net-zero in 2045 and 75% below 1990 by 2030. Wales pledges at least 80% reduction by 2050.†
The Climate Change Act introduced carbon budgets for the UK Government, which cap emissions over successive five-year periods and must be set 12 years in advance.
The UK government is putting into force the Clean Growth Strategy, which is a Ten Point Plan for a green industrial revolution, encompassing clean energy, buildings, transport and technologies. Moreover, the government pushes for individual plans across key sectors such as Energy White Paper, Transport Decarbonisation Plan and Heat and Buildings Strategy (UK NDC, 2020).
UKís NDC establishes a reduction of 68% of 1990 levels including LULUCF emissions. If LULUCF is excluded, this is equivalent to 69% or 251 MtCO2e. CAT classifies this as strong target and once the UK adopts national policies (2030 ban on the sale of fossil fuel cars and a ramping up of renewable energy investment, particularly into offshore wind) it will bring their emissions in line with the 1.5∞C goal. Also, the UK has a net-zero goal by 2050. CAT cannot rate, at this moment, the UK target due to complexities derived from Brexit (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).

In the energy generation sector, Nepal proposes to expand clean energy generation from 1,400 MW to 15,000 MW, being 5,000 MW unconditionally, ensuring that 15% of the total energy demand in the country will be supplied by clean sources.† Nepal also states that 5-10 % of such clean energy will be generated from mini and micro-hydro power, solar, wind and bio-energy. (Nepal, NDC 2020)
In the transport sector, Nepal pledges that, by 2025, 25% of the sales of all private passenger vehicles will correspond to electric vehicles (including 2 wheelers), and 20% of all four-wheelers. This target will reduce 8% of the emissions compared with the BAU scenario. Moreover, by 2030 the share of sales will reach up to 90% of all vehicles and 60% considering all four-wheelers, which corresponds to a reduction of 23% compared with the BAU scenario. (Nepal, NDC 2020)
In the residential sector, Nepal focuses on the improvement of cookstoves, ensuring 25% of electric stoves by 2030 and in the installation of biogas plants (household units and large scale). Nepal aims to reduce 23% of the emissions compared with BAU. Lastly, in the AFOLU sector, Nepal relies on forest conservation (45% of the country by 2030) and sustainable management of 50% of Tarai and Inner Tarai forests and 25% of middle hills and mountain forests (Nepal, NDC 2020).

France,"A five-year planning strategy called the Plan ressources pour la France (Resources for France Plan) aims to define and lessen the dependency on natural resources for production and growth.
The Loi relative ‡ la transition ÈnergÈtique pour la croissance verte (Energy transition for green growth law), a national framework strategy for 2015, incorporates the policy. Additionally, it is an endeavor to control and promote a circular economy. Minerals are one of the natural resources covered in the Resources for France plan. Despite not being a large producer of essential minerals, France has recognized since the 2010s that its needs are growing due to the energy transition and the digitalization. The strategy includes essential minerals because France is heavily dependent on imports.
The ComitÈ pour les mÈtaux stratÈgiques (COMES) and the Bureau de recherches gÈologiques et miniËres (BRGM) are tasked with doing a more thorough mapping of the requirements for essential minerals in relation to the energy transition. 
The strategy also emphasizes recycling as a viable production technique for industrialized nations like France. It urges further investigation into secondary mineral resources.
The proposal also suggests incorporating sustainability standards into the chain of production for vital minerals. Reusing and recycling are viewed as an alternate method to guarantee a local, sustainable supply. The strategy does, however, draw attention to the necessity of a European initiative on social and environmental standards for mining.
The circular economy is supported by policy in part thanks to this five-year strategy. It takes into account the social and environmental effects of key minerals in addition to their economic and security repercussions. This strategy is being developed simultaneously at the national and regional levels; some of the goals outlined in the Resources for France plan are also included in the European Commission's adopted 2020 Circular Economy Action Plan. On December 10, 2020, a proposal for regulating of batteries and their minerals was made."

Japan,"""Based on the Strategic Energy Plan, the Long-term Energy Supply and Demand Outlook presents the ideal structure of energy supply and demand that can be realized if appropriate measures are taken based on the fundamental direction of energy policies by envisioning policy objectives to be achieved on safety, energy security, economic efficiency, and environment, which are the basic ideas of the policies.
""Based on the policies stipulated in the Strategic Energy Plan, which the Cabinet approved in April 2014, METI established the Long-term Energy Supply and Demand Subcommittee under the Strategic Policy Committee of the Advisory Committee for Natural Resources and Energy in order to consider a future vision of a realistic, yet well-balanced energy supply and demand structure. So far, a total of 11 meetings on these matters have been held.
""METI has approved the Long-term Energy Supply and Demand Outlook based on the report compiled by the subcommittee.""
The energy and demand outlook for 2030 serves as de facto energy efficiency and renewable energy targets. For renewable energy, it is described that Japan will aim to increase the share of renewables in total electricity generation to 22-24% by 2030. For energy efficiency, it is described that Japan will aim to reduce its final energy use by about 10%, from 361 million kl crude oil equivalent (coe) in 2010 to 326 million kl coe in 2030.
Original title: ????????????. For the primary energy supply, the envision structure for FY2030 is as follows: renewables 13-14%,Nuclear power: 10-11%, Natural gas: 18%, Coal: 25%, LPG: 3%, Oil 30%. For the power source mix, the structure is for FY2030 is as follows: Renewables: 22-24%, Nuclear power 20-22%, LNG: 27%, Coal: 26%, Oil 3%. Renewables are divided into: Geothermal: 1-1.1%; Biomass: 3.7-4.6%, Wind: 1.7%; Solar: 7%; Hydro: 8.8-9.2%. With a projection of economic growth at 1.7%/year, energy efficiency and conservation measures are also expected to allow a 196.1 bn kWh reduction (reduction of 17%).

India,"The state of Rajasthan is endowed with the highest radiation levels in India and implemented the Solar Policy to harness great untapped resources and meet its Renewable Portfolio Standard requirements. The state targets the installation of 1 to 1.2 GW of solar capacity by 2022, seeks to enhance energy security, create jobs in the solar manufacturing and become a main exporter of renewable power to third party and neighboring states. To reach such targets, the solar policy includes a combination of support tools: First, power producers are exempted from electricity duty on the energy they consume and can apply for incentives under the Industry Scheme. Producers of solar thermal energy are granted access to the water quantity required for generation by local authorities and solar power will be guaranteed grid access under both the Indian Solar Mission and the Rajasthan Solar policy. The solar policy seeks to widespread the installation of solar water heating systems on all industrial buildings where hot water is required, large residential buildings, government and private hospitals, hotels and swimming pools. Solar steam systems in residential institutions and hospitals will also be supported. Second, the solar policy creates the RE infrastructure Development Fund to finance transmission network extension, road construction and ease the integration of RE generation. Such Fund will be financed by the collection of a development charge of INR. 10 Lacs per MW installed transfered to the Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation. The policy also provides for the regulation framework to develop solar parks larger than 1, 000 MW capacity. Such Parks will include Solar Power Plants, Manufacturing Zones, R & D and Training Centres. Third, the Solar Policy creates the Solar Research Center of excellence. The solar policy will fulfill Rajasthan s engagements in the National Solar Mission -install 66 MW of solar capacity- and install additional capacity following a competitive bidding process. Central government will tender 50 MW of solar PV and 50 MW of solar thermal and best bidders will be guaranteed a fixed price by Discoms of Rajasthan. Moreover, the policy will promote the installation of solar PV and solar thermal plans for direct sale to Discoms of Rajasthan with a maximum capacity of 200 MW by 2013 and an additional 400 MW by 2017. Eligible projects will also be selected through auctions. The state will promote off grid and decentralised solar applications and hybrid systems in replacement of diesel based generators. The solar policy also facilitates the installation of solar power producers targeting solar power trade with third party or other states. In fact, Rajasthan aims to become a major issuer of solar Renewable Energy Certificates within the Indian Renewable Portfolio Obligation."

For the LULUCF sector, Chile focuses on forest restoration, afforestation and reducing deforestation as carbon sink. The final goal is to reach neutrality by 2050.
Chile planns to strengthen its policy legal framework, exchange technology with international actors and build capacity through education at national level. Also, public-private alliances are supported by the government to finance action. In the building sector, Chile relies on targets, codes and standards and in the transport envisages to incite e-mobility and hydrogen to replace diesel. Fuel switching is also the way forward in the industry sector, from coal to electricity and biogas besides an increment in the efficiency. In the electricity sector, Chile wants to reduce GHG emission by phasing-out mineral coal, shifting to thermal and solar electrification (Chile NDC, 2020).
According to CAT this updated NDC still is insufficient to comply with Paris Agreement goals. However, this NDC is stronger than the previous, establishing 95 MtCO2e in 2030 as a wider goal, having the peak of emissions in 2025 followed by a downward trend until net-zero in 2050 and a smaller emission budget until 2030. Also, Chile establishes a target in the forestry sector.
While analysing the conditional target of up to 45% GHG emission reductions by 2030 from 2016 levels, CAT concludes that is a bolder target. However, there are no details in the NDC for a complete assessment (Carbon Action Tracker, 2021).

The subsidy scheme applies only to grid-connected rooftop solar PV systems comprising solar PV modules, rooftop support structure, solar grid inverter, cabling and protective devices. Grid-tie system only will be considered.
Solar power that is not consumed in the residential building can be exported to the TANGEDCO grid and will be eligible for solar net-metering. In solar net-metering the consumer pays for the net energy imported from the TANGEDCO grid (= energy imported from the grid minus energy exported to the grid). Exported energy will be credited up to a limit of 90% of the imported energy during a 12 months settlement period. To avail of solar net-metering the consumer needs to apply to TANGEDCO.

One of the Guiding Principles of the document is that, ìclimate change adaptation and GHG emission reduction must be carried on in parallel for effective response to climate change, with adaptation a priority in the initial phase.î Off the specific objectives one is, ì GHG emission reduction and removal to become a mandatory index in social and economic developmentî
Under implementation, the strategy document also states that, ìit is likely that after 2025 that Vietnam has to focus on GHG emission reduction to protect the earthís climate system. ì
GHG emissions reduction target of 1% per year without international support and of 2% per year with international support. Energy intensity (per unit of GDP) reduced by 1.5-2% per year. 5% renewables by 2020 and 11% by 2050"

Hence, New Caledonia planned to replace the heavy oil power plant to a gas thermal power plant by 2024 and renewable energies. In addition, apply a new legislation regarding energy efficiency on equipment.
French Polynesia states a reduction of 3.7% compared to 2016, Saint-BarthÈlemy a reduction of 15% compared to 2013, Saint Pierre and Miquelon to limit the increase in 6.6% compared to 2016, and lastly Wallis and Futuna, which will reduce its emissions by 20% by 2030 compared to 2016.

In 2000, it was revised and a new price at which a utility or supplier has to purchase renewable electricity from private generators was fixed. It ranges from Ä 0.03/kWh (for secondary biomass) to Ä 0.39/kWh (for PV under 5 kW). From 1999, wind electricity producers could receive either a fixed tariff of Ä 0.06/kWh or the average hourly market price of electricity plus a bonus of Ä 0.03/kWh. Rates are specified for both capacity and output credits. Output credits are the highest for wind and solar plants: Ä 0.07/kWh over a five-year period. Capacity credits are the highest for waste incineration plants; output credits for these plants vary depending on the size of the plant and on the relative importance of any co-fired fossil fuel. They also decrease annually. Buy-back rates for these plants are about Ä 0.06/kWh in the first year. Buy-back rates also depend on continuity of supply to avoid surges in power sold to the grid.

Kenya,"The Kenya National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy (NEECS) was developed to further enhance ongoing efforts, by providing a roadmap towards setting and achieving energy efficiency goals. This strategy has established targets in the five thematic sectors to be accomplished within a five-year timeline up to 2025.
The Household Sector has two targets. It aims to increase the number of household appliances subjected to Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) from six to ten. It also aims for the use of improved efficient biomass cookstoves at 50 per cent of all households currently using biomass cookstoves.
There are six targets to be met in the Building Sector. First, there should be 10% share of newly built floor area compliant with energy efficiency requirements in the total building stock from the current baseline of zero. Second, two per cent of the buildings should have adopted American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standards for energy efficiency of buildings, or equivalent. Third, energy loads due to lighting in public buildings will be reduced by 50 per cent. Fourth and fifth, 20 per cent of public buildings and 25 per cent of the affordable houses the government is planning to build should be green, respectively. Lastly, the sector should develop Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) for buildings.
This strategy has also set two targets for the Industry and Agriculture Sector. The sector is expected to increase the number of energy audits carried out from the current 1,800 to 4,000. The sector is also expected to implement the recommended energy conservation measures to save 100 MW of power demand, 250 million litres of heavy fuel oil and 9 million litres of industrial diesel oil.
In the Transport Sector, three targets have been set. The first is the improvement of fuel economy. Increasing the share of electric vehicles in the transport sector has been identified as the second target, aiming to reach five per cent. Lastly, NEECS targets to increase the number of passengers using commuter trains from 116,000 to 150,000 per day.
In the Utilities Sector, the strategy identifies the need to reduce transmission and distribution system losses from 23 to 15 per cent."

he Climate Settlement is officially known as ìRecommendation of the Energy and Environment Committee: Climate Settlement, Innst. 390 S (2011-2012), based on the White Paper on Climate Efforts, Meld. St. 21 (2011-2012)î. This document reinforces the targets set out in the 2008 agreement on climate policy on transportation; construction; agriculture and carbon uptake by forests; and mainland industry and petroleum activities. Some of the core measures the document recommends to be adopted within these areas include:
ï Create a climate and energy fund for development of technology and industrial transformation;
ï Increase the offshore supply of electric power from the mainland, while safeguarding biological diversity;
ï Increase state subsidies for investment in, and operation of, municipal public transportation and other environmentally-friendly forms of transportation;
ï Adopt climate measures in agriculture and carbon removals in forests through active forest management;
ï Maintain or increase the forest carbon stock through active, sustainable forest policies;
ï Improve incentives for the use of bio-energy derived from wood (with emphasis on forest residues);
ï Increase the mandatory sale of bio-fuels to 5%;
ï Tighten the energy requirements in the building code to passive house level in 2015 and nearly zero energy level in 2020.
The settlement includes three main targets:
ï In relation to the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, Norway plans to exceed its commitment by 10%
ï Norway plans to become carbon neutral by 2050. However, if an ambitious global climate agreement is entered into through which other industrialised countries commit to undertake large reductions in GHG emissions, Norway will bring forward this target to 2030
ï By 2020 Norway plans to commit to reducing its GHG emissions to an equivalent of 30% of the 1990 emissions level (and up to 40% contingent on global action)
While emissions reductions can be carried out in Norway or abroad, the paper states that Norway will have a domestic reduction goal of two-thirds of GHG emissions."

The targets set for 2030 are as follows:
- Double the energy self-sufficiency ratio (18% at present, including nuclear power generation) and the domestically-developed fossil fuel supply ratio* (26% at present), and raise the energy independence ratio to about 70 percent from the present 38 percent.
*The ratio of fossil fuel supply from domestic and overseas interests that a Japanese company has a share in the total supply
- Raise the ratio of energy from zero-emission power sources such as nuclear and renewable energy to 70 percent (by more than 50% in 2020) from the present 34%. For this purpose:
Build more than 14 additional nuclear plants (nine by 2020).
Raise the overall plant capacity utilization rate to 90 percent (85% by 2020) from the 60% in 2008.
Maximize the use of renewable energy.
Cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the residential sector by half.
Maintain and raise energy efficiency in the industrial sector to the highest level in the world.
Maintain or achieve top-level shares of global markets for energy-related products and systems.
According to the plan, the goal is to reduce domestic energy-related CO2 emissions by 30 percent in 2030 compared to the 1990 level. Its intention was to increase nuclear energy in the mix to raise Japan's level of energy self-sufficiency, on the assumption this would also enhance energy security.

Brazil,"ìThe Sector Plan for the Reduction of Industry Emissions (Industry Plan) is a commitment by the Brazilian society and the private and public sectors with the promotion of a sustainable development path for the national industry. The Planís objective is to prepare the countryís industry for the new future scenario that is emerging in the horizon, in which carbon productivity, equivalent to the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions per product unit, will be as important as work productivity and other productive factors in defining the international competitiveness of Brazilian industry. In order to do that, it will be necessary to establish management systems for the greenhouse gas emission of the industrial sector as tools to improve competitiveness, in a process similar to the implementation of environmental management systems in the past.
ìThe design and implementation of the sector plan is based on the rules established by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and do not affect the ongoing validity of such rules, including the commitment with international financial and technological support for the actions of countries not included in Annex and flexibilities for them with regard to measurement, communication and verification of emissions and emission reductions.
ìThe Industry Plan is based on three pillars:
(i) Gradual implementation of a measurement, reporting and verification system (MRV) for the emission of greenhouse gases produced by industrial activities.
(ii) Action Plan with a set of measures and instruments to encourage emission reductions.
(iii) Creation of an Industry Plan Technical Commission (CTPIn) comprising representatives of the government, industry, civil society and academia, responsible for detailing the Planís actions, monitoring and periodical reviews.
ìThe Industry Plan adopts as reference a 5% reduction target for emissions in industrial processes and energy use in the industrial sector, in relation to the trend scenario (Business As Usual) projected for 2020.

European Union,"The EUís NDC establishes the target of reducing at least 55% of its emissions by 2030 compared to 1990. It is an economy-wide and absolute pledge, covering all sectors and gases (EU NDC, 2020).
The overarching measures in force in EU are three-folded: Emissions reduction targets under current EU legislation are divided between the sectors covered by the EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS), which is put a price in the carbon and established a cap for emission allowances; by the non-ETS sectors under the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), which individual binding targets for Member States is set considering emissions not covered by the EU ETS; and land-use related emissions and removals addressed by the regulation on emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF).
Additionally, the EU passed regulations to improve energy efficiency (improve at least 32.5% by 2030), for increasing renewable energy in final energy consumption (at least 32% by 2030) and reduce CO2 emissions in the road transport sector, increasing performance (reducing emissions) of cars and lorries.
The EU agreed to reduce at least 55% GHG emissions below 1990 levels by 2030. Though this is a stronger target, it is not enough to reach 1.5∞C, and a proposal between 58% and 70% is needed (European Parliament proposed 60%). Also due to methodological complexities caused by Brexit, CAT cannot rate this NDC. Nevertheless, CAT points out that the reduction would have to be between 2,324 ñ 2,329 MtCO2e or 52.8% (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).
CAT suggests more ambitious policy measures, which would lead to significant reductions. For instance, revise the Renewable Energy Directive based on new proposals from the ëFit for 55%í package, and decrease the emissions cap of the EU-ETS, steering a coal phase-out and better performance for cars and the increase in the share of electrical vehicles.

The Norwegian Domestic Emissions Trading Scheme ran from 2005-07, and generally aligned itself with the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, covering only CO2 emissions. Industrial CO2 emitters are allocated a total amount of emissions, and reducing emissions generates credits which can be sold to other emitters needing more. The Scheme covered CO2 emissions from energy use and some industrial processes, and only covered installations not subject to the CO2 Tax (see separate entry) or special agreements on emissions reductions with the State Pollution Control Authority. According to this agreement, existing process industry plants agreed to commit themselves to a 20% reduction in all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2007, compared to 1990 levels.

Before this, the tax on petrol was regulated via the Petrol Tax Act, which entered into force on 1 January 1983, and the Act on Taxation of Gas Oil and Diesel Oil, Heating Oil, Heating Tar, and Crude Oil was regulated via the Act on Taxation of certain Oil Products, which entered into force on 3 October 1977. From 1 June 1999 a tax differentiation between light diesel and diesel low in sulphur was introduced, to encourage the use of diesel low in sulphur, which is less polluting than light diesel. This was accomplished and a change took place soon after to the effect that almost all diesel sold was low in sulphur. The purpose of further differentiation from 1 January 2005 favouring sulphur-free diesel was likewise to encourage the use of this type of diesel in favour of diesel low in sulphur, and this has been successful. In addition, tax differentiation has been introduced in order to achieve environmental goals other than direct reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

Denmark,"A key instrument for reaching the goals for emission reductions is the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS), a cap and trade based CO2 allowance scheme for energy production and energy-intensive industries. The EU Member States progress with this trading scheme for greenhouse gas emissions in order to fulfil the international climate commitments set out in the Kyoto Protocol and Paris agreement, aiming to reduce CO2 emissions from covered installations and flights. The installations subject to EU ETS covers about half of Danish emissions of greenhouse gases. Statutory and administrative basis for the scheme have been established. Allowances prices have particular significance for Danish emissions as they affect the need to initiate other mitigation initiatives. Introducing the Marked Stability Reserve has had major impact on price levels thus supporting national efforts.  Efforts to further increase the level of ambition in EU climate policy are key in the Danish governmentís climate change policy to achieve ambitious national targets. The legislative framework of the EU ETS (2021-2030) was revised in early 2018 to enable it to achieve the EU's 2030 emission reduction targets. The revision includes measures to further support mitigation of emissions and reducing the amount of free allocated allowances through a significant update of the Carbon Leakage list and updated benchmarks. An independent third party verifies reported emissions and applications for free allowances."

Denmark,"An existing subsidy scheme for green transition of transport was increased with DKK 50 million, and the total DKK 475 million was advanced to 2021. The funds are aimed at transition of ferries, extension of charging infrastructure or transition of commercial transport. The final allocation will depend on political negotiations."
Denmark,"A part of a political agreement from 2020 regarding the transport sector is to replace the current blending mandate with an obligation to reduce GHG intensity of fuels on a well-to-wheel basis. The new scheme is based on a technological neutral regulation, which promotes the use of RE-fuels with low GHG-intensity including new fuels such as Power-to-X based fuels. The obligation to reduce the GHG intensity of fuels is phased in from 3,4 % in 2022-2024 increasing to 5,2 % in 2025, 6 % in 2028 and 7 % in 2030. The target is estimated to reduce the CO2-emission by 0,7 mio. ton in 2025 and 1,4 mio. ton by 2030. From 2025 at the latest ILUC values or similar values will be a part of the regulation."
Denmark,"A subsidy scheme of total DKK 230 million in 2021-2022 for green transition of transport was agreed in December 2020. The funds are aimed at transition of ferries, extension of charging infrastructure or transition of commercial transport. The final allocation will depend on political negotiations."
Denmark,"Maintaining the increased blending mandate in 2021 was decided in 2020 in order to avoid an increase in CO2 emissions related to the blend in requirements for biofuels in petrol, diesel and gas on 5.75% that would otherwise have entered into force. At the same time, a specific blending mandate for advanced biofuels was fixed at 0,3%."
Denmark,"Since June 2020 the Minister for Transport has agreed with municipalities and regions on ""Climate-friendly cooperation agreements on green public transport"". With the agreement municipalities and regions are obliged to buy CO2-neutral or zero-emission busses whenever their old (diesel)busses needs to be replaced. By February 2021 23 municipalities and all five regions were a part of the agreement. This entails that approximately 63 percent of all public bus transport is covered by the agreement."
Denmark,"Denmark has a long experience with energy efficiency and energy savings in buildings. From 1990 to 2017 energy consumption for heating has been reduced by 16.1% per m2. The goal is to reduce energy consumption in new buildings by 75% by 2020 relative to 2006. 
All new buildings must, according to the Danish building code, be constructed as nearly zero-energy buildings (NZEB).
The benefits of reducing energy consumption are tangible: less fossil fuel is consumed and the environment has improved substantially. Strict and progressively tightened building regulations since 1977 have ensured a stable demand for energy-efficient building technologies.
Energy labelling of buildings must be implemented after finishing the construction of a building and on the sale or rental of the building - primarily heating consumption. This applies in principle for all buildings, irrespective of size, apart from production facilities, factories etc. The energy performance is expressed by a numeric indicator of primary energy in kWh/m2 per year based on the primary energy factor.
The Energy Performing Certificate (EPC) consist of an energy label and an energy plan. For publicly owned buildings over 250 m2 the EPC must be prepared regularly every ten years. Furthermore all large buildings over 600 m2 which are frequently visited by the public must display a valid EPC in a prominent place clearly visible to the public."
Denmark,"Private owners of agricultural land can get grants for establishment of broadleaves or conifer forests, nursing of these in the first 3 years, establishment of fences, mapping and or accounting of the area - if the forest will be established in an area planned for afforestation."
Denmark,"Minimum energy requirements and energy labelling of appliances: Energy labelling (A-G) of white goods, lighting, air con etc. is compulsory within the EU. The European Community also has mandatory energy requirements for some 20 energy-consuming products, such as electric motors, circulators, white goods etc. There are also voluntary labelling schemes (Energy Star, Energy Arrow, windows, boilers) for a number of products. Danish authorities play an active role both in negotiation of the requirements and in securing compliance with the compulsory requirements - e.g. through market surveillance. The Danish Energy Agency offers advice on its website to end-users in order to promote energy-efficient appliances and products."
Denmark,"This support scheme supplies subsidies for companies, which offer electric heat pumps on subscription for private year-round housing. The subsidy pool among others is designed to give aid to citizens who wish to convert to an electric heat pump, but who have limited financing opportunities. The subsidy will amount to approximately DKK 25.000 per electric heat pump on average."
Denmark,"ìBetterHousesî is a scheme (voluntary and market-driven system) from the Danish Energy Agency focusing on energy renovation of buildings. The aim is to make it easier for owners of buildings, mostly homeowners, to energy renovate by creating a ìone stop shopî for energy renovation, where the owner only has to contact one certified building contractor and to get an overall counselling on energy renovation of the entire building. Skilled workmen are educated under the BetterHouses program to be advisors on energy renovation. The Danish Energy agency approves the BetterHouses firms and professionals like architects, engineers, craftsmen, energy consultants and building designers can take training courses to become BetterHouses advisors. The training is carried out at academies of higher education. A Better Houses advisor can manage the process and can follow the project all the way from plan to completed renovation."
Denmark,"The long-term renovation strategy supports the renovation of the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings. The strategy shall contribute to the fulfilment of the EUís long-term goal for 2050 of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95% compared with 1990. The goal is to achieve a highly efficient and decarbonised building stock by 2050 and facilitate the cost-effective transformation of existing buildings into nearly zero-energy buildings (NZEBs). The strategy includes the status of energy efficiency of buildings in Denmark, normative instruments (e.g. component-specific requirements in connection with renovations), financial instruments (e.g. taxes and grants) and informative instruments (e.g. information for citizens, energy rating of buildings or additional training of tradesmen)."
Denmark,"On the 19 May 2020, the Government reached a political agreement to ensure green renovation of the social housing sector in 2020 and from 2021-2026. The agreement entails a structural shift in the Danish National Building Fundís support system containing a new green support criterion, a new green guarantee and a fund for experiments that will improve the energy efficiency of buildings in the social housing sector."
Denmark,"Reducing energy consumption by increasing energy efficiency and promoting energy saving is a very important element for Danish energy policy, hence phasing out oil-, and gas boilers alongside other less efficient heating sources by subsidies for conversion to green solutions have been essential towards fulfilling the ambitions of the climate agreements. This is through various support schemes, subsidising these conversions to more green alternatives in various models, ranging from one-time subsidies to the individual citizen to subscription solutions, which aid citizens who wish to convert to an electric heat pump, but who have limited financing opportunities."
Denmark,"Reducing energy consumption by increasing energy efficiency and promoting energy saving is a very important element for Danish energy policy. With the increased interest seen from both a political perspective besides the immense interest seen from the public, further grants have been granted to the support schemes for phasing out oil-, and gas boilers by subsidies for conversion to green solutions."
Denmark,"The Building Pool targets energy savings in private year-round housing. Among others, the subsidy pool supports the replacement of oil and gas burners with  heat pumps (i.e. reduction in CO2-emissions from the individual heating sector), insulation of the climate screen and optimization of the operation of the building. 60 % of the pool is targeted at projects, which include conversion to heat pumps under the condition that the building is located outside an area, where it has been decided to establish district heating."

The agreement states initiatives within the following areas: Converting forests for biodiversity purpose, continued agreements for nature, nature and biodiversity, urban nature and outdoors recreation, open land management and the farmerís role as resource manager, modern nature conservation, and simplification of legislation."
Denmark,"In 2020 a total of DKK 190 million has been allocated from the EU Common Argricultural Policy for targeted nitrogen regulation. With 190 million DKK for compensation to farmers, the targeted regulation in 2020 expects to establish a total of 380,000 ha of catch crops on Danish fields. If not sufficiently catch crops are laid out with in the voluntary subsidy scheme, farmers will have an uncompensated requirement to lay out additional catch crops or alternatives. This ensures that the effort is implemented."
Denmark,"The Climate Agreement introduces an aid scheme for the production of ìbiogas and other green gasses.î According to the Climate agreement, the aid scheme will consist of six successive competitive bidding processes based on clear, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria, where producers of biogas and gasses based on renewable energy sources compete for the aid. The aid will be granted as operating aid for a period of 20 years in the form of a price premium in addition to the market price of the gas produced. The bids will be assessed based on the premium and the offered volume . Fully implemented in 2030 the scheme aims at reducing emmission by 0,7 mil. tonnes CO2e/yearly by producing 10 PJ biogas and e-methane."
Denmark,"In 2020 a separate standard has been established for humus soils, which implies that nitrogen standard for crops and grass in rotation is reduced by 25 or 50 kg / N per hectare depending on crop type."
Denmark,"In 2020 the utilization requirements in the DK Fertilizer Order has been adjusted, so that a larger share of the amount of nitrogen applied from livestock slurry and manure must count towards compliance with the farmers nitrogen quota."
Denmark,"In 2020 a ban of fertilization and spraying on ß3 protected areas was adopted. The proposal aims to ensure that spraying, fertilizing and plowing no longer take place on a number of meadow areas with a total area of ??37,000 hectares, which are covered by the Nature Conservation Act."
Denmark,"One of the measures with an effect on return of carbon to the soil has been the ban on burning of straw residues on fields. The ban has resulted in greater return of carbon to the soil, and therefore increased carbon storage in the soil, as well as increased use of straw as a fuel. Both uses will result in a net reduction in CO2 emissions. Not burning straw prevents the methane and nitrous oxide emissions associated with the burning. On the other hand, there are some emissions of nitrous oxide in connection with the return of nitrogen to the soil when the straw is mulched. The measure works by regulating behaviour, and the ban was introduced from 1990. The measure was implemented in the form of a statutory order under the Environmental Protection Act, and compliance is monitored by the local authorities. The objectives are conservation of carbon in agricultural soils and reduction of air pollution."
Denmark,"The majority of new public forests are stateowned. The purpose of new state forests is to establish resilient and multifunctional forests, e.g. recreational nature close to cities/users, groundwater protection, carbon storage, nutrient reduction and support biodiversity in generel.

The initiative is extended to 2021. Financed by the EU rural development programme"
Denmark,"In 1996 the Statutory Order on Waste was amended to introduce an obligation for municipalities to assign combustible waste to incineration (corresponding to a stop for disposal of combustible waste at landfills) from 1 January 1997. As a result of this, large quantities of combustible waste that used to be disposed of at landfills are now either recycled or used as fuel in Danish incineration plants."
Denmark,"A tax is imposed on waste for incineration or landfilling. The taxes are DKK 475 per tonne for landfilling and DKK 60,9/GJ for incineration."
Denmark,"Weight-and-volume-based taxes (e.g. on various packaging, carrier bags and PVC film) encourage a reduction in packaging consumption and thus the quantities of waste. The weight-based tax is based on an index that reflects the environmental burden of the materials used."
Denmark,"In 2005 the Programme for Cleaner Products etc. was replaced by the Danish governmentís ìEnterprise Schemeî which refunds CO2 taxes to business. The waste part of this programme was aimed exclusively at enterprises. A total of DKK 33 million for the five-year period 2004 to 2008 was earmarked for the waste part of the scheme. The subsidies were to be used to reduce the environmental impact of waste. Two projects with reduction of methane emissions were supported: a. To address the obstacles and to improve the method, another biocover-project was initiated in 2007 as part of the Enterprise Scheme. The project was performed on another landfill (i.e. not the landfill in the biocover-pilotproject 2005-2006 carried out with support from Danish EPA and the EU LIFE programme), and was taking the identified difficulties into account. A reduction of the methane emission of 79-93 % was reported in the project. b. In 2007 subsidies from the enterprise scheme were also given for establishing methane recovery and test pumping at 11 landfill sites. The results were reported in 2011 and showed a reduction of the emission of methane over a five year period equalling 84,435 tonnes of CO2 equivalents. In 2015 no money is assigned to the Entreprise Scheme, and it is expected, that this will also be the case in 2016."
Denmark,"On the basis of the EU Landfill Directive, demands on the establishment and operation of landfills in Denmark have been tightened with Statutory Orders No. 650 of 29 June 2001, No. 252 of 31 March 2009, No. 719 of 24 June 2011 and No. 1049 of 28th of August 2013 on landfills. According to the Statutory Orders on landfills, methane in landfills for mixed waste must be monitored. From landfills where significant amounts of biodegradable waste are disposed of, methane gas must be managed in an environmentally-sound way."
Denmark,Biocovers is a technique that uses compost as a cover on landfills. The microorganisms in the compost increases the oxidation of methane in the top layer.

It will be analyzed whether or not part of the waste managing in public spaces can be funded through waste fees."
Denmark,Municipalities are required to specify in the tender for bulky waste schemes that a sorting must be carried out in order to achieve a high level of real recycling and preparation for reuse. The sorting will ensure that a lesser part of the bulky waste is incinerated.
Denmark,"The Executive Order on Waste stipulates that the municipalities must, as of 1 January 2022, set a requirement of 60 per cent actual recycling of the collected plastic waste when the waste is offered for treatment. The municipalities must ensure a high level of real recycling of all recyclable waste types."
Denmark,"A target of 50 percent reduction of certain plastic take-away packaging in 2026 is set. The goal must initially be sought to be achieved through a binding agreement and collaboration with the restaurant industry. If the goal is not reached by binding agreement, further regulation must be implemented."
Denmark,"The national implementation of the extended producer responsibility for packaging must be introduced no later than January 1st 2025. This will include all types of packaging in all types of materials. The extended producer responsibility must ensure that Denmark achieves the recycling targets for packaging in 2025 and 2030 by creating a strong financial incentive for reducing packaging, reusing packaging, and designing packaging that is easy to recycle and in high quality."

Denmark,"The new and improved Danish waste inspection will be targeted at the companies where there is the greatest risk that the rules will not be complied with, and where the environmental risk of not complying with the waste rules is the greatest. Concrete tools, methods and a professional basis must be analyzed developed for in order to fulfill a strengthened and risk-based waste supervision. On the basis of this analysis, a decision on the new model for waste inspection till be made in 2021."
Denmark,"As a result of the Danish climate agreement of June 2020 for a green waste sector and circular econony a productivity gain on the increased recycling of plastics is expected. This is due to an expected synergy effect of the several initiatives in the agreement. This includes a clear framework for the sector, the market gaining access to both household and acquired waste and the increase and streamlining of waste streams."
Denmark,"By political decision, limits for nitrous oxide emissions from treatment plants that treat waste water that is the equivalent of at least 30,000 peopleís effluent (PE) will be introduced from 2025 onwards. These limit values are introduced to ensure that the total effluent from waste water treatment drops by 50 percent compared to today. Based on preliminary experience, it will, no later than 2025, be discussed by the political parties whether this limit should also be introduced for treatment plants that treat waste water that is the equivalent of less than 30,000 PE. Nitrous oxide emissions from treatment plants is the main source of greenhouse gas emissions from the Danish waste water utilities, but ongoing projects indicate a potential for significant emission reductions by implementing improvement initiatives. This includes adjusting the advanced online control of the aeration and dosing of a carbon source as well as lowering of the specific ammonium loading, taking into account the nitrous oxide emission."

Slovakia,"The aim of this measure is to reduce environmental impact at all stages of the life cycle of these products. The measure sets regulations for domestic appliances, motors and other electric equipment with the negative environmental impact throughout the products lifecycle that use energy (for example: boilers, computers, cars, household appliances etc.).The automotive industry is forced to consider the entire life cycle of cars. Besides a reduction of fuel consumption and exhaust emissions, the production as well as the end-of-life phase have to be taken into account. Eco-Design includes an effective approach to integrate the aspects of resources availability, manufacturing technologies, in-use behaviour and recycling procedures. A challenge in the application of Eco-Design in automotive industry lies in the complex interactions of different, partially conflicting influencing factors. The use of vehicles produced in this  way has the effect of reducing CO2 emissions in the transport sector."
Slovakia,"Energy efficiency is one of the main pillars of the energy policy of the Slovak Republic. According to the National Energy and Climate Plan, Slovakia set its national contribution in the field of energy efficiency at 30.3% by 2030. Energy consumption measures, under which energy savings are manifested as a reduction in final energy consumption, are broken down by different sectors (buildings, industry, the public sector, transport and appliances). The measure is determined minimum requirements as regards the energy performance of new and existing buildings, the renovation of buildings, which constitute the most important source of possible energy savings."
Slovakia,Prohibiting to register any new internal combustion engine vehicle (petrol and diesel cars) after 2035. Only buses can be registered.
Slovakia,"Increase cars efficiency and to decrease the GHG emissions production from cars, vans. Effect of European legislative - regulation  (EU) 2019/631 of the European Parliament and of the Council which sets CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger cars and for new light commercial vehicles."
Slovakia,"The objective of this measure is to limit the CO2 emission from the energy industries, manufacturing industries and from industrial processes, as well as nitrous oxide emissions from the chemical industry and perfluorocarbons from production of aluminium. ETS stimulate use of biomass in fuel mix of energy producers and urge technology innovations. This policy is economic and regulatory measure with high positive impact on reduction of GHG emissions."
Slovakia,"The measure can be found in the Slovak legislation in the Act no. 309/2018, amending Act no. 309/2009 Coll. on the promotion of renewable energy sources and high-efficiency cogeneration and on the amendment to certain acts. The Slovak Republic plans to speed up the implementation of using biofuels. Fuel suppliers are obliged to blend fossil fuels with biofuels with a minimum energy share as follows: 7.6% in 2020, 8.0% in 2021 and 8.2% in 2022, 8.6 % in 2023, 8.8 % in 2024, 9.2 % in 2025, 9.5 % in 2026, 10 % in 2027, 10.4 % in 2028, 10.8 % in 2029 and 11.4 % in 2030. This act also introduces an obligation for LNG and CNG suppliers. The minimum energy share of biological fraction is determined as follows: 2 % in 2023, 3 % in 2024, 4 % in 2025, 6 % in 2026, 8 % in 2027, 10 % in 2028 %, 12 % in 2029, 14 % in 2030."
Slovakia,"Together with emission limits, taxes can help accelerate reductions by giving consumers incentives for buying low-emission vehicles, creating a market-pull effect. The planned registration fee will take into account not only the performance and age of the vehicle but also the environmental aspect (greenhouse gas emissions)."
Slovakia,"Stricter technical control with the combination of new taxes for internal combustion engine vehicles can incentivize drivers to buy low-emissions vehicles. Roadside inspections for emissions measurement are a complementary measure to vehicle technical inspections to ensure that vehicles are kept in a safe and environmentally sound condition. In order to carry out an increased frequency of inspections, it is necessary to purchase equipment for technical control of vehicles. Roadside technical inspections should focus in particular on detecting vehicles on which diesel particulate filters (DPF) have been removed or disabled. The analysis of the measure assumes that DPF will be removed mainly in category EURO 5 and 6 vehicles, with 15-20 % share of vehicles . The measure can have a significant preventive effect and the non-compliance rate could fall by up to 20%."
Slovakia,"The aim of the increased representation of electric vehicles in the transport system is the transition to low-emission forms of transport, which is a trend strategically defined at the level of the European Commission and it is part of low carbon economy. Road transport is currently dominant polluter, especially in urban areas. For the development of electromobility, it is necessary to ensure the continuity of direct support for purchasing electric vehicles by creating a new support project. The measure proposes to build on previous support projects and consider expanding the range of supports. New support project, prepared by the Ministry of Economy, has the opportunity to capture a new generation of vehicles and use its potential. Foreign experience shows the success of the implementation of similar measures, support from the state is the key process in market creation for alternative fuel vehicles."
Slovakia,The aim of this measure is to establish a long-term stable financial framework for development of integrated infrastructure for charging of electric vehicles following the example of the neighbouring countries. The infrastructure support will lead to standardization of technical parameters of the charging network and compatibility with charging networks in other countries. The development of a separate instrument to support the development of infrastructure also requires a need for distribution and access to charging stations in areas located out of the core network.
Slovakia,"The modal shift from private vehicle use to public transport corresponds to the Strategic Transport Development Plan of the Slovak Republic up to 2030 ñ Phase II. The behaviour can be changed through complementary measures such as information campaign, low emissions zones, education in schools, car sharing. Public buses according to other measures should be only electric or using other alternative fuels after 2030/2035. According to the newest plans of the Ministry of Economy, there could be also a small penetration of hydrogen technologies to public transportation. Modal split to environmentally friendly modes of transport (rail, water, intermodal, public transport) will reduce the negative impact of transport on the environment by optimising and reducing the potential of unimodal transport."
Slovakia,"According to the Strategic Transport Development Plan of the Slovak Republic up to 2030, the road freight transport performance has recorded marked growth since 2000, while the significance of transport modes suitable for the transport of large freight volumes without excessively burdening the infrastructure and the environment is decreasing. The aim of this measure is to support for the development and use of rail transport."
Slovakia,Increase in the nuclear share in the medium term (2020 ñ 2025) due to the commissioning of two new nuclear reactors at Mochovce nuclear power plant.
Slovakia,"The Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) are important instruments that should contribute to the enhancement of the energy performance of buildings. EPCs play a central role in the context of the Article 20 (2) EPBD, which asks Member States to provide information on the energy performance certificates and the inspection reports, on their purpose and objectives, on the cost-effective ways and, where appropriate, on the available financial instruments to improve the energy performance of the building to the owners or tenants of the buildings. National INFOREG-EC system for energy certification of buildings allows to create an energy certificate according to the law Act no. 378/2019 Coll., Amending and supplementing Act no. 555/2005 Coll. on the energy performance of buildings and on the amendment of certain acts as amended and in accordance with Decree no. 55/2020 Ministry of Transport and Construction of the Slovak Republic. Energy certification is mandatory for buildings or their separate parts which are going to be sold or leased to a new tenant, for buildings in which more than 250 m2 of the total floor area is used by a public authority and frequently visited by the public, and for new buildings or a major renovation of existing buildings."
Slovakia,"Prohibition of some F-gasses placing on market according to regulation (EU) No 517/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on fluorinated greenhouse gases. The regulation was transposed into slovak national law - Act no. 286/2009 Coll. on fluorinated greenhouse gases and on the amendment to certain laws. This Act laso regulates the obligations of natural and legal persons that handle fluorinated greenhouse gases, products and equipment, and the competence of state administration bodies."
Slovakia,"By amending the Waste Act, municipalities and cities are obliged to ensure the sorting of municipal biological waste. The main goal of this change is to reduce, ideally remove kitchen organic waste from mixed municipal waste. In practice, this means that in addition to the current colored containers and containers for separate waste collection, there will be additional container for food residues from the kitchen. The aim of this measure is to reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste that is disposed to landfill by collecting the biodegradable municipal waste. The measure reduces methane emissions produced by waste decomposing in landfills."
Slovakia,"Non-refundable financial contribution (NFP) from the Program to support the insulation of family houses through the Ministry of Transport, Construction and Regional Development of the Slovak Republic.

The budget for the program is 30 million. euro"
Slovakia,"Deposit return schemes provide a financial incentive for consumers to return drink containers . This communicates that containers have a value, rather than being viewed as trash. The aim of this measure is to increase recycling of single-use plastic and aluminium containers and reduce their landfill disposal. Materials covered in the scheme include PET bottles and aluminium cans. Legislation to enable the scheme has already been introduced and adopted by the Slovak Government this year. Slovak legislation sets a target of collecting 90% of plastic packaging by 2027 and another ambitious target of 90% collecting cans by 2029. At the same time, the system administrator makes a voluntary commitment to ensure a 90% collection rate of all packaging by 2025."
Slovakia,"On 12 December 2018, the Government of the Slovak Republic adopted Resolution No†580/2018 on the draft transformation plan for the Horn· Nitra region. Point B.3 of the resolution sets out the timeframe for the gradual closure of the Handlov· and Nov·ky coal mining fields belonging to the company Hornonitrianske bane Prievidza (HBP, a. s.). The HBP, a. s. company has in its portfolio, in addition to the mines Nov·ky and Handlov· situated in the Horn· Nitra region, also the C·ry mine situated in Z·horie region. In connection with the cessation of state subsidies and the planned declining in mining activities in the Slovak Republic, it is assumed that the C·ry mine will end its activities in 2023. Due to the characteristics of the brown coal mined here (also used in agriculture), it is possible, that the production will continue in limited range after 2023. The measure decreases fugitive methane emissions from underground coal mining."
Slovakia,"On 03 July 2019, the Government of the Slovak Republic adopted Resolution No†336/2019 to the Action Plan for the Transformation of the Horn· Nitra region proposing the starting points for solving the situation associated with the shortening of general economic interest in electricity production at the Nov·ky power plant and the subsequent development of declining coal mining in connection with the planned decline in mining activities. According to the Action Plan for the Transformation of the Upper Nitra Region, the Nov·ky Plant will remain the primary heat source for the region after its transformation from solid fossil fuels. The future solution of the heat source itself will meet the strictest emission and environmental standards and did not further burden the environment, at the same time it should be able to offer energy at a price that will not further disproportionately increase cost of living in the area. In this regard the use of the thermal potential of mining waters is proposed. District heating will be more energy efficient with high share of RES (biomass, solar energy, geothermal energy, waste and/or cogeneration technology)."
Slovakia,"The potential for reducing nitrous oxide emissions in agriculture is mainly related to the efficiency of manure management, particularly to the handling and storage of manure and slurry and their application to the soil in a low-emission way. The measure reduces ammonia and nitrous oxide emissions by more efficient storage of manure and by manure isolation from the environment. The measure can be found in several strategic documents, it is in the Decree of the Ministry of Environment of the Slovak Republic no. 410/2012 Coll., which implements certain regulations of the Act on Air (137/2010 Coll)."
Slovakia,"Mechanicalñbiological treatment (MBT) plants treat municipal solid waste, residual after source separation, with the aim to minimize the environmental impact associated with the residues landfilling and to add values to waste outflows for a potential utilization. MBT consists in a combination of mechanical processes (shredding, size, density and magnetic separation, densification, etc.) and biological treatment (aerobic or anaerobic degradation) of the organic fraction mechanically separated. The goal of this measure is to support for MBT plants constructions, their practical advantages are the reduction of the volumes of waste and the organic matter content of the waste, which is sent to final landfill disposal."
Slovakia,"One of the effective ways to reduce methane from livestock is to increase the digestibility of the animal feed ration and change the animal's feeding plans. Increasing the digestibility of the feed ration has a significant effect on increasing the performance of animals. The objective of the measure is to mitigate methane emissions from enteric fermentation through lifestock feeding interventions such as intensive feeding with active substances particularly cereals and amino acids; feeding better-quality diets to increase milk production per cow or growth of beef cattle, which will decrease methane emissions per unit of product; selecting feed to reduce the production of the volatile fatty acids acetate and butyrate which provide methane precursors, and by increasing the propionate volatile fatty acid which consumes methane precursors. Although nitrous oxide emission sources are not targeted by this measure, we note that matching the crude protein intake of livestock feeds to meet livestock requirements will reduce nitrogen excretion, thereby reducing the pool of nitrogen available for emission as nitrous oxide."
Slovakia,"Biogas is composed of methane and carbon dioxide, with trace amounts of other gases. It is produced by the anaerobic digestion (AD) of organic materials, which can include livestock manures, food waste and biomass from crop residues or purpose-grown crops. The biogas produced can be converted into bio-energy in the form of electricity, heat, or transport fuel. The remaining product after the AD process is digestate composed of water, nutrients and organic carbon. It can be recycled as fertiliser for crop cultivation to substitute for mineral fertiliser. This measure is planned for cattle and pig farms. Options for effective support: support those who process waste in biogas plants, direct support for farmers, do not provide support only in the form of guaranteed purchase of electricity, establish purchase rates for renewable electricity and high efficiency co-generation, support for biogas plants with lower power capacity and also consider other impacts on the environment.  Legislation has to be adjusted for support to be effective."
Slovakia,"Policy of switching from urea based to nitrate based fertilisers is generally promoted under policies associated with air quality objectives and is linked to the high potential for ammonia volatilisation from urea fertilisers. The measure also reduces nitrogen leakage and nitrous oxide emissions. The use of stabilised nitrogen fertiliser in the context of greenhouse gases this usually refers to nitrification inhibitors and can be a very effective mitigation strategy for reducing nitrous oxide emissions, but it has not been included in the projections, we would like to implement the measure and include in projections in the future."
Slovakia,"The measure objective is reduction of nitrous oxide emissions through reduction of inorganic nitrogen fertilisers use, alongside with other improvements in fertiliser management that lead to decreased losses of nitrogen to air and water. The goal of reducing the consumption of nitrogen fertilisers by 20% by 2030 was implemented in WAM scenario, the measure aims to reduce the consumption of inorganic nitrogen fertilizers. There is a transitional period implemented in the emission projections. It is expected that the Slovak Republic will negotiate its own percentage reduction in fertiliser consumption and will claim a transitional period, which will also be enshrined in legislation. It will be necessary to adjust the emission projections in line with the future valid national strategy and legislation. This measure has been included in the list of measures based on the adopted Farm to fork strategy. The mechanism of the measure is not yet precisely defined, but the measure is in synergy with other reported measures number 24 and number 21. As part of the preparation of the future Common Agricultural Policy Strategic Plan, the plan will follow the rules of good agricultural practice and precision farming. One of the planned measures is the so-called Nutrient management plan, which is currently being prepared and will be introduced into agricultural practice after its elaboration and approval."
Slovakia,"Improvements to the energy efficiency of buildings should benefit in particular consumers. Deep renovation of buildings will take place, where attention must also be paid to the significant renovation of the building's technical system. This concerns the heating and hot water preparation system for residential and non-residential buildings, but also ventilation (including the reuse of heat recovery), cooling and lighting of non-residential buildings and the use of control and automation systems."
Slovakia,"Organic farming is a perspective way of farming which has a positive impact on the environment including greenhouse gas emissions while addressing various economic and social aspects, contributing to the sustainable development of the rural areas as well as to the protection of all components of the environment. Organic farming has been existing in Slovakia since 1991. There is a significant increase since 2004 due to implementation of commitments of the Government of the Slovak republic under the Rural Development Plan for 2004 - 2006  and Rural Development Programmes (2007 - 2013, 2014 - 2020), which aimed to achieve the implementation of organic farming for at least 5% of the total agricultural land. Therefore it can be concluded that the regulatory stimulation by the State to introduce organic farming has helped the development of organic farming in Slovakia and could help to increase organic farming in the future."
Slovakia,"Afforestation of agricultural land has a high carbon sequestration potential, this measure was implemented within Rural Development Programmes. Afforestation of non utilised agricultural land was supported by 15 projects with a total afforestation area of 100 ha in the first Rural Development Programme from 2004 to 2006. According to the Rural Development Programme 2007 - 2013, afforestation continued by 28 projects with a total area of 133.35 ha and according to the Rural Development Programme 2014 - 2020, forest trees were planted on an agricultural land fund with a total area of 332 ha in Slovakia during the both seven years programming periods. There was also a project implemented to plant fast-growing trees on 35 ha of non utilised agricultural land."
Slovakia,"The aim of this measure is to maintain and restore permanent grasslands. Maintenance of arable land and grassland with a high natural value, introduction of extensive grazing practices and conversion of arable land to grassland are included in Agri-environment-climate measures (article 28) in Rural Development Programme 2014 - 2020.  The trend shows that the gradual reduction of the area of permanent grasslands will most likely continue, mainly due to the transfer of unused and abandoned pastures and meadows to the forests, ecological and water protection restrictions, introduction of forest-pastoral systems (agroforestry), transfer of land under nature conservation management. In the case of introduction and application of appropriate socio-economic and ecosystem measures and PES schemes (payments for ecosystem services), the acreage in this category could be stabilized and its use improved."
Slovakia,"The objective of this measure is a support for forest practices improvement, which will lead to increased carbon sequestration in the context of sustainable forest management. Modify the tree species composition in order to increase the resistance of stands to drought and reduce vulnerability to biotic and abiotic factors. Maintaining vital forests by limiting the negative impacts of climate change on forests through practices aimed to adapt forests to climate change (promoting use of alternative management models for the purpose of adjusting tree species composition, use of appropriate provenances). Similar measure can be found as a Forest-environmental and climate services and forest protection (article 34) in Rural Development Programme 2014 - 2020 and also in Action Plan 2015 - 2020 of National Forestry Programme of the Slovak Republic."
Slovakia,"When organic materials break down in the absence of air in landfills, methane is produced and slowly released into the atmosphere. For large landfill sites, a number of gas extraction and recovery systems are available, but few options exist for small to medium sized landfills due to their scale or design.  Passive drainage and biofiltration will be used as a method for managing landfill gas. This involves the installation of gas drainage trenches into the cap of a landfill, which direct the landfill gas into a layer of material consisting of compost and shredded wood and timber, referred to as a biofilter.  Recycled materials such as compost and crushed concrete and brick aggregate can be used successfully in the passive drainage and biofiltration system. This sustainable and low-cost technique can help to reduce the greenhouse impacts of small to medium sized landfills."
Slovakia,The measure corresponds to the actual Plan for the development of public water pipes and public sewerage. Development in wastewater management will continue as observed in the last decade. This development is characterized by slow increasing of population portion on sewerage with target of 75% in the year 2040. The aim of the measure corresponds to the declaration of the Government of the Slovak Republic when joining the EU that until 2015 all municipalities over 2000 inhabitants (70% of total SR population) will be connected to treatment systems. The added 5 % to target of 75 % represents population in smaller villages close to water resources. This development can be characterised by gradual development of sewer systems and modernisation of wastewater treatment plants to comply with requirements of EU strategies in water sector. It is assumed that the number of holding tanks will decrease due to extension of sewer systems and growing domestic wastewater treatment plants.
Slovakia,"The measure is governmental subsidy scheme to engage private households in alternative energy generation. The support is aimed at small scale electricity generation (fotovoltaic systems, wind turbines) and heat generation for residential buildings (solar, biomass, heat pumps). The Slovak Innovation and Energy Agency (SIEA) launched the project in 2015. Since its launch, there have been three rounds of the project, Ä45 million was available in the first phase until the end of 2018. In the continuation of the Green Households II project, Ä48 million was available for the period 2019 to 2022.

Netherlands,"Small consumers are allowed to settle the amount of electricity returned to the grid with their (annual) consumption of electricity, as long as the amount of electricity returned to the grid is lower than or equal to their consumption taken from the grid. This is referred to as net metering, which stimulates the installation of PV-panels on roofs of homes. This measure has been implemented in the Electricity bill in 2004. It is intended to run until the end of 2024, then to be gradually phased out and stopped altogether per 2031. Solar panel owners can (under certain conditions) reclaim VAT on the investment in solar panels and their installation. The government plans to introduce a zero VAT rate for the supply and installation of solar panels on (or in the close proximity of) homes per 2023. After implementing this measure in 2023, solar panel owners (in many cases) no longer have to reclaim VAT. This reduces both the administrative burden of the solar panel owner and the workload of the tax authorities. The Dutch government therefore expects the reduction of the aforementioned administrative burden to lead to an increase in the use of solar panels."
Netherlands,Reduced rate on energy taxes for local cooperations: under specific conditions the members do not have to pay energy tax over their own jointly produced electricity production in the first level (schijf) of energy consumption. Under the new climate agreement the scheme is as per 2021 replaced by a new subsidy scheme (the SCE)
Netherlands,"A Wind Energy Roadmap was adopted as part of the Energy Agreement (2013). The roadmap outlines how the generation capacity of offshore wind energy is to be increased from 1,000 MW to 4,450 MW in 2023. In 2018 the roadmap was extended to 2030 (with ambition of 11000 MW in 2030). In 2022 the ambition was further extended to around 21,000 MW around 2030. The roadmap is a basis for (decisions on) tendering processes  for new off shore wind parks. The extended Offshore Wind Energy Roadmap outlines where new wind farms will be built in the North Sea between 2024 and 2030. As support to further development of offshore wind, various ministries work together in an off-shore wind ecological research programma (Wozep) that started in 2016. Also a North Sea Agreement was concluded with other stakeholders on the integration of offshore wind energy into a more broad use of the Netherlands territorial part of the North Sea."
Netherlands,"The Rutte-3 government included in its coalition agreement the plans to phase out coal fired electricity plants by 2030. This was worked out in a letter to parliament in May 2018. Of the 5 dutch plants, two older plants have to close down already earlier. In the period before, plant owners may enable their plants to use other fuels, such as sustainable biomass. Lateron (letter of March 2019), because of the Urgenda law case, the government decided to close down the first plant (Hemweg) even earlier, by the end of 2019."
Netherlands,"In dec ember 2021, after a legislative process that started in 2020,  it was announced that per 1 januari 2022 a legislative CO2-cap for coalfired power plants would be introduced, in order to reduce CO2-emissions in the electricity sector. This measure was in reaction to the Urgenda ruling and therefore temporary (period 2022-2024). In June 2022 the maximum percentage was abolished to ensure enough gas will be available in coming winter."
Netherlands,"Tthe previous government of Rutte-3 and the climate agreement, announced its plans to introduce a gradually increasing minimum national CO2 price for CO2 emissions from electricity production, such in addition to the EU-ETS. This should contribute to investments that are less harmful to the environment.  As of the 5th of April 2022 the legislation has entered into force."
Netherlands,"This subsidy scheme, in place as of 2021, which is the follow-up of the fiscal Postal code area cooperative project subsidy scheme, stimulates projects of (local) energy cooperatives for local production and use of electricity via solar PV, wind of water power on land. Installations and participants should be in the same and/or adjacent postal codes. The production of renewable energy is subsidized, using a similar approach as in the SDE++."
Netherlands,"The Act that regulates production, transport and distribution of electricity. The Act is regularly updated; in 2006 e.g. the act on Independent Grid management (in dutch: WON Wet onafhankelijk netbeheer) changed the electricity (as well as gas act) with rules to assure independency of the grid management, aimed at fair market competition on supply and sales."
Netherlands,"Through a North Sea Agreement, parties want to achieve the basis for development of a Strategic Agenda 2030 and a National Northsea Programme 2022-2027, that combines various interests in developing the sea, including nature, fisheries, shipping, wind parks etc. The increase of off shore wind parcs is one of the reasons this intended agreement is mentioned in the Climate Agreement decisions from june 2019."

Netherlands,"The Lower Value Added Tax on isolation measure started in 2009 and involves a reduced VAT rate on labour for work performed on housing for the purpose of energy saving. The reduced VAT rate is applicable to the labour component in the process of installing insulation material and (insulating) windows. The rate and conditions were adapted over the years. It started with options to apply a lower 9% rate on labour cost for some isolation works on floors, walls and roof of dwellings older than 2 years"
Netherlands,The Subsidy Scheme for the Sustainability and Maintenance of Rental Properties offers private landlords or institutional investors the opportunity to apply for a subsidy to make their regulated rental properties more sustainable.
Netherlands,"Persons with a mortgage who implement energy-saving measures in their own homes are able to borrow an increased sum for that investment. In this respect a mortgage provider can omit that portion of a mortgage that is used for energy saving measures (up to a sum of Ä9 000), when determining the financing charges (within the frame of the creditworthiness check).  The scheme is updated yearly."
Netherlands,"A revolving fund for heat projects and other sustainability measures for owner-occupants and homeownersí associations (Warmtefonds, Heat Fund) has been set up to enable broad participation. It follows up on the earlier national energy loan fund possibilities (NEF). The terms and conditions for citizens were revised a number of times and ownersí associations were also included in order to boost the fund. In total, since 2014, the Heat Fund has provided nearly Ä818 million in financing to home owners and homeownersí associations."
Netherlands,"Owner-occupants and homeownersí associations have been able to apply for a subsidy since 2016 as a stimulus to extend energy saving measures. A subsidy, which comprises approximately 30% of the investment, will only be issued when at least two of the following energy saving measures are performed, under the conditions set out in the subsidy scheme: wall insulation, cavity wall insulation, roof insulation, floor or ground insulation and replacing windows with low-emissivity glass. When at least two energy saving measures are implemented under this requirement, the owner-occupier or ownersí association can also receive an additional subsidy for further energy saving measures, such as insulating doors or customised ventilation. If ONE measure is applied in stead of two the subsidy percentage is approximately 15%. In order to stimulate taking more measuers. The measures and associated requirements largely correspond to the measures and requirements for the National Heat Fund (Warmtefonds, formerly NEF)) This means that the subsidy and loan can be combined to cover the entire investment. Since January 1st 2021, owner-occupants can apply under another scheme (see PAM on ISDE) for an investment subsidy for renewable energy and energy saving according to the above mentioned rules. As from January 1st 2023 the SEEH subsidy for owners associations will be called SVVE and will be easier to use."
Netherlands,"The Housing Valuation System was changed on 1 July 2011 to included an appraisal system of the energy performance of the housing (on the basis of the energy label), to promote investments in energy-saving measures. The Housing Valuation System sets the maximum rent on the basis of the characteristics of the house. By including the energy label in the Housing Valuation System the maximum rent is linked to its energy label. The change to the Housing Valuation System came into effect on 1 July 2011 for dwellings with an energy label and for dwellings that must have an energy label under the regulations. A transitional period up to 1 January 2014 applied for dwellings that did not yet have an energy label; from 1 January 2014 the Housing Valuation System with an energy label applies to all rental homes. As of 1 October 2015 the Housing Valuation System was amended further: the WOZ (Valuation of Immovable Property Act) value was preferred as a basis for the rental sum, marking the end of the planned evaluation, immediately after the conclusion of the transition period."
Netherlands,"This pilot programme is basically an experimental programme with some pilot areas to feed experiences and know how into the included knowledge exchange programme aimed to support a structured, area-specific approach with the ambition of making many neighbourhoods free of natural gas. Such area-specific apporaches are delegated to municipalities themselves. Housing associations have an important role to play in driving the transition forward. Their housing stock includes a large number of comparable housing types, which offers good potential for scaling up the efforts to make housing more sustainable. Based on the experiences of this experimental programme, later a more full scale approach is intended to be planned. Includes subsidies"
Netherlands,"Following up earlier agreements a.o. in energie & climate agreements, municipalities have to elaborate transition visions on heat (including the transition to natural gas free areas/neighbourhoods). A subsidy support scheme for external advices (EAW) and a supporting knowledge centre (Expertise Centrum Warmte ECW) support municipalities with expertise and guidance preparing their transition visions on heat and the related implementation plans.

It has a more broad character than climate related investments,  but since 2019 also explicitly includes energy measures (energy saving and renewable energy). Up to 2018 such energy measures were supported by a seperate scheme (EDS)"
Netherlands,"Through the RRE (2019) and RREW (2021) schemes, municipalities may launch projects to stimulate house owners to implement small energy saving measures e.g. for improving heating installations/isolation (control, radiator folium, isolation, etc.). Municipalities may also use the scheme for providing advice to owners on other energy saving measures e.g. roof-, window- or facade-isolation.  The RRE was running in 2019. In 2021 a renewed scheme (RREW) opened, now also including the involvement of tenants (in 2019 still excluded)"
Netherlands,"The block-by-block approach is not a seperate PAM but a structured, area-specific approachapproach underlying some other PAMs (e.g. on  Heat Transition Visions and the pilots on natural-gas-free neighbourhoods). It  involves owners of buildings and inhabitants in making the neighbourhood more sustainable. This block/neighbourhood scale seems very suitable for introducing alternatives to natural gas systems. Municipalities are in the lead and have to describe in what neighbourhoods they plan to implement the approach at what time in their visions on heat transition  (TvW). The national government intends to take care of timely availability of a legal framework for a further block-by-block approach."
Netherlands,"The governement undertakes a multi-annual public campaign on climate-change ('Iedereen doet wat'), that aims to stimulate citizens to undertake sustainability oriented measures and provide suggestions for this. Also campaigns on electric transport are included"
Netherlands,"The starter motor approach encompasses a first larger scale uptake aiming at bundled, combined improvement of energy efficiency of some 100 000 houses in the social housing (rental) sector, trough connection to heat networks and/or application of heat pumps. The larger scale approach aims also at gaining experiences with such a more integrated apprach (innovation, contracting methods, etc.) as well as first cost reductions.  This will be done through the social housing corporations and the government. A subsidy scheme  (see under SAH), started in 2020, supports the actions"
Netherlands,"The SAH scheme offers subsidy options for connecting existing rental housing to an external heat network. It is part of the broader starter motor approach, that encompasses a first larger scale uptake aiming at bundled, combined improvement of energy efficiency of some 100 000 houses in the social housing (rental) sector,"
Netherlands,"Milieu Centraal is the practical guide for sustainable tips and advice. How much can you save with floor insulation? What is the impact of a flight or a kilo of meat? And where do you keep an old video tape? Milieu Centraal provides you with independent, practical and reliable information. Discover what you can do yourself, and how to go about it.

In order to provide a better service information to residents and building owners in the consultation, implementation and financing stages of the renovation of the house/building, a digital platform was launched by Milieucentraal and the government, designed to ensure better alignment of supply and demand in relation to implementing sustainability in homes. This will involve existing initiatives being streamlined as much as possible to ensure uniformity of the information provided."

Netherlands,"A joint bill of the Ministries of Economic Affairs and Climate (EZK) and the Interior and Kingdom Relations (BZK) and contains amendments to the Gas Act and the Environment Act. The bill gives municipalities the power to draw up local rules for the heat transition from natural gas to sustainable alternatives. On the basis of this legislative proposal, municipalities can instruct the network operators to cut off districts designated in the environmental plan from natural gas. The bill is therefore also the final piece of the district-oriented approach."
Netherlands,"For all new construction, both residential and non-residential, the permit applications must comply with the requirements for Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) since 1 January 2021. These requirements arise from the Energy Agreement for sustainable growth and from the European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD)."
Netherlands,"In addition to energy performance requirements for new builds, there are also requirements for refurbishments and renovation. This is a summary of the legal requirements for renovation in the Building Decree."
Netherlands,"The Buidling Decree from 2012 is the basis  for legal requirement in building s with regard to safety, health, energy, environment, etc. It contains a.o. requirements for connections to gas, electricity, water, etc, as well as requirements with regard to ventilation, environmental performance (MPG) and energy performance (EPC). Energy performance certificates (EPCs) for buildings show how energy-efficient homes, offices and hospitals are.  An EPC is mandatory when homes and other buildings are put up for sale or rent or when construction is completed"
Netherlands,"With this support scheme, provinces may apply for financial support to offer subsequently possibilities for smaller owners of social real estate in their provinces in their efforts to make the buildings more sustainable.  The programme aims to help in 'unburdening' them in this transition."
Netherlands,Group of policy measures for Built Environment
Netherlands,"Energy taxation scheme, introduced in 1996 as Regulatory Energy Tax (REB) and since 2004, after various changes, known as Energy Tax (EB). The objective of this policy is to boost energy savings by putting an incentive on reducing the consumption of gas and electricity, which should direct consumers toward more energy efficient behaviour. More recent CO2 reduction became more important, resulting e.g. in tariff shifts from electricity to gas. The energy tax is levied a.o. on electricity and natural gas, and the level depends on the level of energy consumption of a customer (degressive tariff structure). There are some exemptions and refund options (under conditions) e.g. for companies that participate in Long Term Agreements on energy efficiency. In 2013 a surcharge system (ODE) was introduced in order to cover expenditures resulting from the sustainable energy production scheme. Also this system differentiates between levels of energy use and between type of users (e.g. companies or dwellings). In 2020 through some shifts, the relative contribution to the ODE by dwellings was limited and that of many companies increased. Since 2023, the sustainable energy surcharge (ODE) will no longer be levied, because from now on the subsidy for sustainable energy will be financed from the general budget."
Netherlands,"Deduction scheme from fiscal profits to promote investments in new energy efficient technologies. Entrepreneurs may deduct (under conditions) part of the investment costs through generic schemes, such as the KIA Kleinschaligheidsaftrek for certain small scale investements, but may also use EIA to deduct part of the investment in certain energy efficient equipment from their fiscal profits. Percentages vary over the years. Yearly a list is published with applicable technologies and criteria. Proposals can be submitted for techniques to be considered for, and if approved, included on the energy list. The equipment must save more energy than the prevailing equipment available on the market. This means that only the latest types of equipment are eligible for the EIA. Also a general EIA application can be submitted, using an energy-saving calculation to demonstrate that equipment that is not on the energy list meets EIA criteria. Since 2013/2014 as result of the Energy Agreement, the EIA focuses mainly on energy-saving technologies (for renewable energy options, companies are referred to other policies and measures). In 2020 also more attention for CO2 reduction other than energy related was introduced (if part of a broad CO2 reduction plan from companies)."
Netherlands,The Gas Act from 2000 encompasses rules on transport and delivery of gas and implements also rules from EU directives on the internal EU energy market from 1998 (e.d. 98/30/EC and 2003/55/EC). The Act is regularly updated. In 2006 the act on Independent Grid management (in dutch: WON Wet onafhankelijk netbeheer) changed the gas (as wel as electricity) act with rules to assure independency of the grid management.  As of july 2018 the Gas Act changed to facilitate the approach towards districts/blocks that are free of natural gas connections.  The obligations with regard to gas connections for new buildings changed and  many new buildings will not have to receive a gas connection in future; this change applies to small users (max 40 m3 gas/hour) such as dwellings and smaller offices. Exceptions remain possible in important situations of common interest.  The ACM (Autoriteit Consument en Markt) is charged with supervision on the Gas Act.
Netherlands,"The Environmental Protection (or Environmental Management) Act  and its implementation in an Activities Decree is a comprehensive set of legislation on environmental issues. It provides a legal base for environmental plans, environmental requirements and standards, permits, enforcement measures, decrees, etc. Many issues are detailed in the Activities Decree. These parts of the Environmental Act and decrees will be part of the Environmental Planning Act in 2023. Obligations differ per type of company and per type of environmental issue. A.o. it contains obligations with regard to energy efficiency (a.o. the Energiebesparingsplicht), obliging companies, non-residential buildings etc that consume in excess of 50 000 kWh of energy or 25 000 m3 of gas to adopt energy saving measures with a payback time of 5 years or less. The competent authority ñ mostly the local municipality ñ can enforce compliance. In 2015 a set of Recognised Lists of Measures (in Dutch: EML Erkende Maatregelenlijst) has been added to facilitate companies and enhance this obligation, while in 2019 also a method was incorporated on determining the paybacktime of energy eficiency measures and so reduce the space for discussion between the competent authorities and companies about measures they have to take. Regulations are updated regularly. Also regulations on (larger) combustion engines (on CH4 emissions etc.) are included in the Wm."
Netherlands,Producers are made accountable for the reuse and recycling of the textiles they produced.
Netherlands,"The Green Deal approach is a framework instrument, consisting of a series of separate green deals concluded over the years. Green deals are voluntary agreements between parties in society and government to tackle specific obstacles in green growth related projects. Citizens, companies, local councils and stakeholder organisations are continually finding their own ways of being more energy efficient and sustainable, but may encounter obstacles that may require governmental assistance. In specific cases therefore covenants are agreed upon between parties and government to try to deal with these issues. Green deals involve sustainability projects and actions and may relate to energy, water, bio based economy, food, mobility, scarce resources, biodiversity, building practice and/or non-energy climate related issues. Each deal is a seperate covenant, described more in detail on websites and, where applicable, in overviews of PAMs."
Netherlands,"The Top Sector Energy (TSE), one of the more broadly operationg top sector approaches, works with a number of cooperative programmes and consortia ('TKIs') e.g. on off-shore wind, urban energy, new gas (incl.CCS) etc. Next to a general support based on planned R&D (via a TKI-toeslag and some theme specific schemes), it has additional supporting subsidy schemes such as DEI (demonstration projects), HER (renewable energy technologies) and the mission oriented MOOI"
Netherlands,The HER/HER+ aim to contribute at achieving climate related ambitions at less cost through subsidy for innovation projects.  The HER subsidy scheme on renewable energy started in 2014  and was extended in 2020 with a number of other CO2 emission mitigation subjects and renamed to Energy Transition innovation scheme (HER+).
Netherlands,"The SME Innovation Incentive in Top Sectors (MKB Innovatiestimulering Regio en Topsectoren  or MIT) is a subsidy schema to support R&D by SME related to the top sector approach. This applies to all domains and themes of the broad topsector approach (more broad than energy innovation). The Ministry (EZK) uses the MIT scheme to encourage SMEs to cooperate and innovate within this top sector. It encompasses various subschemes on MIT Knowledge vouchers, MIT Feasibilityprojects, MIT R&D cooperation projects, MIT Innovation brockerage  and MIT Innovation networking. The scheme is implemented through the provinces"
Netherlands,"To complement the SDE+ scheme with a scheme for smaller renewable energy systems, the investment subsidy scheme ISDE was started in 2016. This was also a follow up of  agreements under the Energy Agreement and intends to contribute also to reduce gas consumption for heating. Initially households and small commercial users could apply for an allowance for the purchase of heat pumps, biomass boilers, solar water heaters, pellet stoves and small wood-fired boilers. From 2020 the scheme was (also for reasons of limiting NOx and other emissions to air) limited to heat pumps and solar water heaters, while in 2021 also subsidy possibilities for various types of (added) isolation measures were included for dwellings."
Netherlands,"The government aims to reduce the gas production in the Groningen field to zero over the coming years. The gas production is already well under 12 billion Nm3  levels, the safety level recommended by the State Supervision of Mines (Staatstoezicht op de Mijnen (SODM)). In the gas production year 2019-2020 production was 8,65 billion Nm3. The coming years it will be further reduced to zero in the Groningen field. Reason for the reduction is the seismic activity in the region."
Netherlands,"To ensure that in 2050 everyone has enough to eat and can buy the goods they need, like clothing and electrical devices, the economy needs to become circular, with basically no waste. To achieve this, the Government-wide Programme for a Circular Economy (RBCE), entitled 'A Circular Economy in the Netherlands by 2050', was presented to parliament in September 2016. The programme sets out what we need to do in order to utilise raw materials, products, and services in more efficient and smarter ways, thus enabling to realise the ambition - the Netherlands circular by 2050.  In this transition, many parties participate: companies, governments, knowledge institutes, NGOs and many more. The government has selected 5 economic sectors and value chains that will be the first to switch to a circular economy. The agreement has further been worked out in 5 transition agenda and an implementation programme. The 5 economic sectors for which Transition Agenda's have been made in 2018 are: biomass and food, plastics, manufacturing industry, construction sector and consumer goods. In 2019, an Implementation Programme for a Circular Economy 2019-2023 was adopted that translates the 5 Transition Agendas (Biomass and Food, Plastics, Manufacturing Industry, Construction, Consumer Goods) to concrete actions and projects. The Circular Accelerator assist entrepeneurs in taking the next steps in the circular economy through information, inspiration, a broad network and expertise."
Netherlands,"A National Programme for the circular economy which includes relevant policies and targets. Follow up of the RBCE. Whereas policy had previously focused primarily on the back of the supply chain, this programme will be targeting measures more at the input side (such as circular design) and the user phase by Reducing raw material usage, Substituting raw materials, Extending product lifetime and High-grade processing. In 2018, transition agendas were drawn up for the five supply chains with the most harmful environmental impact. Concrete targets have been formulated and specific policy developed for the most impactful product groups within these chains, namely:
ï Consumer goods: electric and electronic goods; packaging and disposables; textiles; 
furniture.
ï Plastics: plastic packaging; plastics in the construction industry; plastics in agriculture. 
ï Construction: housing; offices and industrial buildings; concrete viaducts and bridges; 
road surfaces. 
ï Manufacturing: Capital Equipment; wind farms; solar PV systems; climate control

Netherlands,"The new Environment and Planning Act (Omgevingswet) is combining and modernising the various related legislation in the fields of the environment, nature and spatial planning (living environment). The Act and supporting decrees will contain much of the legislation from present act and decrees on these subjects, e.g. the Environmental Protection Act and its decrees. The new Act has been adopted by Parliament in 2016; however its operationalisation and introduction still is ongoing. Implementation is foreseen in 2023. It provides for integration of regulations for, among other things, spatial planning, nature, water and the environment which will improve the legal support for an integrated and area-oriented approach to the living environment. Regular updates of the regulations will be implemented, when appropriate. A planned update under one of the decrees (on buildings) concerns new regulations  to enable more sustainable use of roofs. This is recently made available for public consultation.  Also, a National Strategy on Spatial Planning and Environment (NOVI) is included as instrument."
Netherlands,"Climate Agreement: in the Netherlands parties from many segments of society, as well as goverments negotiated a new climate agreement as framework for actions in the Netherlands, aimed at achieving 2030 green house gas reductions ambitions. The government has outlined its policies in a letter to parliament in june 2019 in response to a draft climate agreement, attached to the letter. Many parties have meanwhile signed, many actions are started, some are still further elaborated or negotiated. The full extent of climate policy impacts and steering is part of the obligations under the Climate Act and the periodig Climate Plans"
Netherlands,"In the Climate Agreement of 2019 a hydrogen related programme is planned. After presenting a governments vision to parliament in march 2020 a national programme has been initiated. This will primarily aim at developing the supply of 'green' hydrogen, developing the required infrastructure and cooperation with sectoral programmes, and facilitating ongoing initiatives and projects.  Als synergy between infrastructure and use of hydrogen will be enhanced. More specific actions and instruments (or use of already existing ones) is to follow. The programme partners have started a website for the programma and early 2021 started joint elaboration of a working programme"
Netherlands,"The coordination between the regional implementation (regional energy strategies) and implementation (main energy system) will take place in the inter-administrative programme NP RES (the National RES Programme). Local and regional authorities and the national government will remain responsible for the use of their own range of instruments. In this program, Regional Energy Strategies (RES) are being developed. These include the regional implementation approach for agreements made on a national level in the new planned climate agreement (with focus on wind and solar, the required infrastructure and regional demand and supply of sustainable heath sources) . The RES are being developed in a country wide program of some 30 regions in which all provinces and municipalities participate, together with regional stakeholders. The agreement is that the regions supply their final RES1.0 mid-2021 in view of realization of the ambitions before 2030"
Netherlands,"The Climate Act was agreed by Parliament in Juny 2019. It calls for a 49% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, and ambitions for a 95% reduction by 2050. The Act should give individuals and companies in the Netherlands more certainty about the climate goals."
Netherlands,"To further support enforcement of energy saving measures under the Environmental Protection Act, the parties to the 2013 Energy Agreement have added a mandatory system for the relevant companies of informing the competent authority on measures taken (article 2.15 of the Decree). This notification obligation was due through an RVO website application before july 1st, 2019 and subsequently it has to be updated every four years.  Companies participating to the energy covenants did not have to comply to this system, since they have alternative information duties.  The Recognised Lists of Measures (in Dutch: EML Erkende Maatregelenlijst), introduced earlier, are to be used as starting point for reporting on the type of measures taken. Failure to comply may result in financial penalties. Additional funding has been made available to enhance enforcement by local authorities (VUE and SPUK). In 2023, the legal basis will be changed to the new Environmental Planning Act. The obligation to investigate and report on energy savings measures will be extended to include companies with an environmental permit and/or participating in the EU ETS."
Netherlands,"The energy innovation demonstration subsidy scheme (DEI) is expanded as much as possible from a scheme specifically for energy savings and renewable energy production to a scheme that supports all carbon emissions reduction options, in line with the scope of the Integrated Knowledge and Innovation Agenda (IKIA) that is established under the Climate Agreement. It will also emcompass options for system integration (incl. hydrogen) and for a more sustainable use of resources (circular economy)"
Netherlands,"Following a.o. the shift towards more mission oriented innovation policies by the Rutte 3 coalition agreement, an Integrated Knowledge & Innovation Agenda (IKIA) has been developed in 2019 (with the intention is 5 yearly updates) as support to innovation approaches. The IKIA formules five missions that contribute to a deep emission reduction of greenhouse gases by 2050, respectively diected towards a CO2-emission free electricity generation, buildings and transport, climate neutral industry and agriculture/nature. For 2030, intermediate targets are formulated for each mission. The innovation needs for attaining these targets  are subsequently formulated in 13 innovation programmes (MMIPs). These will serve as the basis for supportting subsidy instruments such as TSE, DEI and HER."
Netherlands,"As of 2020, the SDE+ grant scheme ( the scheme to stimulate the production of renewable energy by subsidizing the as yet not-profitable part of system exploitation) is expanded to also stimulate other techniques that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Its focus shifts towards greenhouse gas reduction in general, instead of renewable energy only and its name to SDE++. In 2021 and following years, other techniques are added to the SDE++ and from 2023 onwards, a flexible reservation will be made for certain energy domains with a higher subsidy intensity (ìfencesî).

Netherlands,"The Green investment schema is a tax incentive scheme, enabling individual investors to put money into green projects that benefit nature and the environment. Individuals who invest in a green fund or save money with financial institutions practicing ëgreen bankingí, receive a lower rate than the market interest rate, however this is compensated by a tax incentive. In return, the banks charge green projects a lower interest rate. Banks require a certificate for applicable green investment projects. The objective of the scheme is to encourage projects that have a positive impact upon nature and the environment, but that do not come into being as a result of their low yield or high risk. The scope of the scheme covers new ñ and hence risky ñ but not yet standard technology and methods that will protect the environment."
Netherlands,"Entrepreneurs may deduct part of the investment costs through generic schemes (such as the KIA Kleinschaligheidsaftrek for certain small scale investements), but may also use MIA and Vamil for certain environmental investments. The Environmental Investment Allowance (MIA Milieu Investerings Aftrek) and Random Depreciation of Environmental Investments (VAMIL Vrije Afschrijving Milieuinvesteringen) are two related deduction schemes from fiscal profits to promote investments in new environmental technologies. It gives a direct financial advantage to certain companies that invest in applicable equipment. Entrepreneurs may deduct part of the investment costs for such equipment from their companyís fiscal profits.  Both schemes use a common list, called the Environment List (Milieulijst), which lists all equipment (combined, almost 400 items) eligible for the MIA and/or VAMIL. A new Environment List is released every year. This list also contains a large array of equipment for greenhouse cultivation and measures that promote a circular economy"

Netherlands,"For the energy transition, sufficient capacity must be available on the gas and electricity grid in time to facilitate the increasing demand for transport on the grid from renewable energy installations. Under the Electricity and Gas Act, grid operators must draw up biennial investment plans for the grids they manage, in which all necessary expansion and replacement investments are described for the coming ten years. The Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) monitors and assesses the investment plans. TenneT, the designated Transmission Service Operator (TSO) for the high-voltage grid (wholly owned by the Dutch Ministry of Finance), and GTS, the owner of the national gas transportation grid, together with the regional grid developed a set of scenarios with data from the available transition plans so that a comparable basis is used in all investment plans for expected developments in the Dutch energy market. In the investment plans, grid operators indicate anticipated bottlenecks and types of replacement and expansions that need to take place at the national and regional level. In addition, investments are going towards innovations to make more intensive use of the existing grid and new developments such as the storage and use of hydrogen. The investment plans provide a detailed overview of the (expected) work on the Dutch gas and electricity network for the coming ten years."

The integrated approach aims at projects on greenhouse gas reduction and improved sustainable use of resources and will include aspects such as joint learning, coordination for infrastructural aspects (grids for electricity, hydrogen , heat, etc.), synergy through and with regioal transition programmes, joint permit and/or subsidy scheme approaches etc. The inclusion of the big-12 should deliver extra 'pull and support'  for the programmes. Preparations are ongoing and the implementation of the CES is planned for 2021"
Netherlands,"A tax is targeted at industrial installations subject to the EU ETS, waste incinerators and facilities emitting large amounts of nitrous oxide (N2O), that are not covered under the EU ETS. Industrial Installations will have to pay a carbon tax, if their emissions exceed their baseline based on EU ETS benchmarks and a national reduction factor needed to reach the emission target of 14.3 Mton CO2/e in 2030. Emissions below this baseline are exempted and are allocated dispensation rights. The tax rate starts at 30 Euros/tCO2e in 2021 and increases with 10,56 Euros/tCO2e annually, for each year between 2021-2030up to 125 Euros/tCO2e in 2030. ETS installations can deduct the ETS price from the tax rate. The methodology, set-up of the system and the tax rate have been investigated by PBL. The system is implemented legally by januari 2021"

Netherlands,"The programme Greenhouse as an Energy Source is the innovation program that stimulates energy saving and the use of sustainable energy in greenhouse horticulture. Greenhouse Horticulture Netherlands and the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (LNV) are working together on this.

The program develops knowledge and (cultivation) techniques to save energy in greenhouses and to use more sustainable energy such as bioenergy, sunlight and geothermal energy. With the input of entrepreneurs, we stimulate innovations that can mean a breakthrough for the sector. To stimulate sustainable investments, we provide knowledge exchange, subsidy schemes and affordable technologies.

The programme Greenhouse as an Energy Source is regularly transformed if e.g. new energy or climate agreements are concluded. Basically it is an innovation oriented programme. With long term ambitions that the energy supply is fully sustainable and cost-effective by 2050, the ambition for 2020 is a maximum of 4.6 Mton of CO2 emissions, to be achieved by means of energy saving measures and the use of sustainable energy. This means -2.6% per year over the 2013-2020 period, as well as 11 PJ in additional energy-saving, as agreed to in the Energy Agreement. The programme is supported by various other (subsidy) schemes such as EG and MEI, described separately in overviews of PAMs."
Netherlands,"The Market Introduction for Energy Innovations (MEI) subsidy scheme is intended for investments in innovative energy systems for greenhouses that reduce CO2 emissions and primary energy consumption. Investments in energy efficient innovative greenhouses can also be subsidised. In this respect there are specific requirements contained in the scheme. They must be innovative energy systems or innovative greenhouses that have only just been introduced. Depending on the type of investment, the subsidy amounts 30% or 40% ."
Netherlands,"The EG scheme on energy efficiency and renewable energy in horticulture offers companies active in greenhouse cultivation a subsidy of 25% for specific measures (contained in an annually-revised list) for increasing energy efficiency (or generating or using renewable energy), for which the maximum subsidy can differ per investment. Clusters of companies can also apply for a subsidy. The EG scheme has various predecessor (EHG, IMM and IRE)"
Netherlands,"The EBG is the Sectoral emission trading system in horticulture (in addition to the larger installations in the sector that have to participate under the EU ETS system). Greenhouse cultivation is the largest energy-consumer in the agriculture sector. To regulate CO2 emissions, a CO2 equalisation system has been set up for this sector. The ceiling for the system has been determined by the government in agreement with sector organisations. The introduction of a market price for CO2 encourages companies to invest in saving energy. The basis for the emissions is the gas consumption set off against heat and CO2 production. The CO2 price is based on the price in the ETS. All greenhouse cultivation companies, with exception of those participating in the EU-ETS (as of 2015, around 15) participate in this system. The CO2 equalisation system will not be linked to the EU-ETS."
Netherlands,"The Guaranteed Loans for Agriculture (Borgstelling Landbouw or BL) facility in 2017 replaced the earlier Agriculture Guarantee (Garantstelling Landbouw or GL) and it allows the government to act as guarantor for a part of a bank loan. The BL is faster and has a wider scope than the GL. The bank makes the application, and the maximum guarantee has been increased, while more types of investments may now also fall under this facility. For innovative investments (in greening stables or greenhouses) extra guarantees can be obtained. Under specific conditions, extra facilities may be applied e.g. for starters (lower provision) and for companies that due to the corona crisis need temporary extra (bridging) loans."
Netherlands,"The climate agreement mentions a possible ambition for the peat meadow areas in the Netherlands of a CO2-eq reduction of 1 Mt by 2030. The ""Key Points for a Climate Agreement"" set out the technical potential of a number of measures, such as underwater drainage. Knowledge development will have to indicate what measures will be effective regarding achieving the ambition of 1 Mt of CO2-eq in reduction. The actual combination of measures that is required to realise this ambition will be determined on that basis and will be realised on an area-specific level. The parties will jointly monitor the progress and effectiveness of the measures. Based on these results, there will be multiple opportunities a year for parties to discuss whether interim adjustment of the measures or ambitions may be necessary. A Peat areas plan has been developed and a national research programme has started (2019). Also pilot projects are initiated (partially already supported under other activities and instruments)"
Netherlands,"In the Climate Agreement, organisations have agreed upon developing measures  aiming to reduce food waste in food production and consumption chains, as wel as to help consumers to waste less food and improve a better balance between sustainable, healthy, safe en affordable food, as well as a proper balance between animal and vegetable proteins in the human diet. To be worked out further."
Netherlands,The subisdy schem on replcement of fertilizers and manure processing is considered for some 10 years starting from 2021/2022 with a view on the ambitions regarding climate and nitrogen emissions. Through high grade processing of manure from intensive livestock farming the ambitions are to reduce greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions and better tuning the fertilization to the needs of soil and crop. The scheme has to fit in with the climate agreement and the EU Nitrate directive. The scheme is still underdesign and consideration.
Netherlands,"The ministry (LNV) has developed together with local governments (provinces) a joint forest strategy. This follows up on the climate agreement that includes intentions of parties on forestation and prevention of deforestation; it includes agreements on extension of nature reserve area, restoration of landscape structures, limiting reforestation and planting of new trees. Existing forests, nature areas, land scapes and public space offer possibilities to enhance CO2 storage. Also public space for infrastructure and agricultural soils offer options, e.g. in combining ambitions on biodiversity, spatial quality, urbanisation and recreation. Furthermore CO2 storage may be enhanced through improved applications/cascading within the chains of wood,  grass clippings and other natural materials from the green areas in public space. The strategy and agenda were presented to parliament in november 2020"
Netherlands,This buy-out scheme aims at targeted approach and buy out by provinces (decentral governments) of NOx intensive livestock farms (on voluntary basis) close to nature reserve areas that may suffer from NOx depositions
Netherlands,"In its vision on ""Agriculture, nature and food: valuable and connected""  the ministry describes its longer term vision on developments towards more circular agricultural practices. In such a circular system, arable farming, livestock farming and horticulture primarily use raw materials from each otherís supply chains and waste flows from the food industry. Circular chains may  be within a company, at local level, within the Netherlands or across national borders. This will contribute towards improving biodiversity as well as circular economy and climate policies. Given the urgent need to decrease nitrous oxide depositions, for the short term a conversion programme for livestock farmers is being set up (with intended start of the first schemes in 2021) to accelerate extensification of the subsector also by offering demonstration/pilot projects as well as subsidiy schemes for farmers that want to change to less intensive and more sustainable practices."
Netherlands,The aim of the measure is to reduce nitrogen emissions and improve nature.
Netherlands,"A subsidy scheme is being proposed by the central government for voluntary ending of NH3 intensive livestock farms all across the Netherlands (more broad than a similar system for farms close to nature 2000 areas, described under a seperate PAM)."
Netherlands,"With the Subsidy Module Agricultural Business Advice and Education, an entrepreneur can apply for a voucher or subsidy. This is aimed at learning about sustainable agriculture, switching to extensive, nature-inclusive, circular or organic agriculture.

Netherlands,The Dutch Eco Driving programme aims to increase energy efficiency from transport by training and awareness actions. It started in 1999 and is based on a long-term strategy. From 2010 (2nd phase) the implementation of the program was designated to the Institute for Sustainable Mobility (IVDM) for a period of four years in order to achieve a transfer of the program to the market. IVDM supports projects that have demonstrated the ability to save CO2 and provides information about saving CO2. As of  2015 (third phase)  the programma is run entirely through non-governmental parties (without structural government finances and involvement). The programma currently being evaluated  whether there will be a new campaign in the second half of 2021.
Netherlands,"The programme contributes to improving the energy efficiency from transport by training and raising awareness, as well as facilitating a diverse set of activities. As a consequence of actions under the eco-drive programme (HNR) and the Energy Agreements, a programme including a communication campaign was implemented promoting proper tyres purchase choice/pressure ('Choose the best tyre'), supported by website information, fact sheets and tips. The programme was evaluated in September 2016 and it was decided that in any event it would continue through to 2018. In 2019 a follow-up programme was started as a result of the governments reaction after the Urgenda court case"

Netherlands,"The BPM is a one-off tax that must be paid when a car, motorcycle or light goods vehicle is registered in the Netherlands for the first time. The amount is determined a.o. by the carís CO2 emissions; BPM is not charged for electric cars. CO2 emission figures for each type of vehicle are listed in the register kept by the vehicle registration authority (RDW Rijksdienst voor het wegverkeer). In addition, when a vehicle is registered on name of an owner, the owner has to pay motor vehicle tax (MRB). The height of this tax depends on e.g. the type of vehicle, weight, fuel, environmental characteristics and region. It is intended that upto 2024 no MRB has to paid for full electric cars and in 2025 a 75% reduced rate applies. For PHEV's a 50% reduced rate applies up until 2025. A further fiscal measure includes a reduced rate on income tax for private use of business cars."

Netherlands,"The Dutch government is taking various measures to partly compensate for the sharp increase in the energy bill of households and companies. Households with a low income also receive an extra one-off energy allowance of approximately Ä 1,300. And they get help to save energy.
Measures for all households: approximately Ä 545 discount for an average energy consumption
1. Lower energy tax on electricity
The rate for energy tax in 2022 is Ä 0.057 (excluding VAT) per kWh lower than in 2021.
2. Higher energy tax refund
The energy tax refund has been increased from approximately Ä560 to Ä785 in 2022. This means that all households will receive an additional Ä225 (including VAT) discount. This is a fixed discount, which does not depend on your energy consumption. 
3. Lower VAT on natural gas, electricity and district heating
From 1 July to 31 December 2022, the VAT on energy (natural gas, electricity and district heating) has been reduced from 21% to 9%. The lower VAT rate applies to all parts of the energy bill that have to do with the supply of energy.
Households with an income around the social minimum receive extra support to compensate for the high energy prices: Energy surcharge of approximately Ä 1,300
People who earn a maximum of Ä 1,310.05 (single person) or Ä 1,871.50 (cohabitant) per month are entitled to the energy allowance of approximately Ä 1,300.
Municipalities will receive Ä300 million to help residents in poorly insulated houses save energy."
Netherlands,"Energy bills for households and small businesses must be reduced. That is why the Dutch government wants people to temporarily pay a maximum price for gas and electricity with an average energy consumption. 
The government's plan is that all small consumers of energy up to a certain consumption will not pay more than a maximum price. The purpose of this is to reduce their energy bills. Small consumers do not have to do anything for this themselves. The price ceiling applies from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023. With the arrival of this price ceiling, the VAT reduction on energy will expire on January 1, 2023.
Small-scale consumers are subject to the price ceiling
Small consumers include anyone with a small energy connection. For example, households, the self-employed, small businesses and associations. The building with the connection must be intended for living or working. 
Anyone who consumes more energy than the maximum numbers pays the rate from the energy contract for consumption above the limit. Anyone who has a contract with rates that are lower than the maximum price of the price ceiling, pays the rate from the contract. No one is therefore more expensive because of the price ceiling.
The temporary price cap applies to both temporary and permanent contracts."
Netherlands,"The TEK is based on the energy consumption and turnover of an entrepreneur. The compensation then consists of a part of the cost increase this year and in 2023. Energy-intensive SMEs will then receive support in the amount of a to be determined percentage of the increase in the energy price (gas and electricity) multiplied by their energy consumption to a fixed amount. set maximum per company (subsidy ceiling). Just like households, smaller offices and self-employed workers can make use of the temporary price ceiling, the so-called small-scale consumer scheme.

Conditions and structure of TEK clear in the short term

The government expects to be able to announce the conditions of the TEK in terms of target group, the total budget, the percentages and the maximum support per company in the short term. Such a scheme must comply with European state aid rules and be approved by the European Commission. As a result, actual opening through the Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO) may last until the beginning of 2023.

That is not enough for energy-intensive SMEs that are already in acute problems and still have the winter of 2022/2023 to go. That is why the aim is to have other measures ready from November to be able to (temporarily) reduce operating expenses for entrepreneurs. The cabinet is working out the options for this as soon as possible."

- Subsidy for charging point advice"
Netherlands,"Temporary subsidy scheme for shore power seagoing vessels

This regulation is intended for natural or legal persons established in the Netherlands who intend to install a shore power supply in a Dutch seaport for the energy supply of seagoing vessels.

This scheme has 2 purposes.
- Reducing nitrogen deposition (the precipitation of nitrogen) on nitrogen-sensitive and nitrogen-overburdened Natura2000 areas and for spatial developments that make use of the Nitrogen Registration System (SSRS).
- Reducing noise and improving air quality by encouraging the construction of shore power facilities in Dutch seaports for the energy supply of seagoing vessels."
Netherlands,"From 1 January 2023, a price ceiling on energy will apply to all households and other small consumers. For gas, the maximum rate will be Ä 1.45 per cubic meter up to a consumption of 1,200 cubic meters. For electricity, the maximum rate is reduced to Ä 0.40 per KWh and the maximum consumption is increased to 2,900 kWh. For energy consumption above the ceiling, households and other small consumers pay the rate as included in the energy contract. For November and December 2022, households will receive a fixed discount on their energy bill of Ä190 per month.

The energy suppliers receive compensation for the energy consumption that falls below the ceiling. This fee is fully used to lower energy prices for consumers and other small consumers. As a result, the support will reach households and other small consumers and the cabinet will prevent energy suppliers themselves from getting into financial problems due to the implementation of the ceiling. The total costs depend on the development of energy prices. If energy prices remain at a comparable level, the total cost of the price cap and the compensation in November and December is estimated at around Ä 23.5 billion."
Netherlands,"The government is releasing an extra Ä175 million for the implementation by municipalities of the one-off energy surcharge of Ä800. A total of Ä854 million is now available for the scheme, which is intended to help households with a minimum income pay their energy bills. . Minister Schouten (Poverty Policy, Participation and Pensions) writes this in a letter to the House of Representatives.

By allocating the extra resources, the government offers municipalities a financial guarantee that they can pay an energy supplement of Ä 800 to all households with an income of up to 120% of the social minimum. The government took the decision after signals from municipalities that the current budget may be insufficient to pay all these households the energy allowance. In order not to run a financial risk themselves, a number of municipalities opted to provide the energy allowance to a smaller target group or to pay out a lower amount per household.

At the end of March, in response to a motion from the House of Representatives, Minister Schouten gave municipalities the guarantee that they would be compensated if it turned out that the budget was insufficient. Now that the financial security is there, the minister expects that municipalities will no longer hold back and will actually provide all households with an income of up to 120% of the social minimum with a one-off energy allowance of Ä 800."
Netherlands,"As the largest office owner in the Netherlands, the Central Government Real Estate Agency implements the 'Roadmap sustainability of governmental buildings'. The roadmap indicates how our government buildings will become CO2 neutral by 2050, in line with national climate policy ambitions.

New buildings are built according to the NZEAB standard."
Croatia,"After 31 December 2018 all public buildings in the Republic of Croatia in which they reside or are owned by public bodies must be constructed according to the nZEB (Nearly Zero Energy Building) standard, and the obligation for all other newly constructed buildings occurs after 31 December 2020. These legal provisions ensure that all newly constructed buildings from 2021 onwards are according to the nZEB standard. However, in order to ensure the correct application of these directives, but also to encourage energy renovation of buildings according to the nZEB standard, in the next period it is planned to conduct a series of information and educational activities to promote construction and renovation according to the nZEB standard.
The measure has no direct effect on reducing energy consumption, but rather supports the regulatory measure for the construction of new buildings according to the nZEB standard, as well as a promotion measure for energy renovation up to the nZEB standard, which will result in measurable reduction of energy consumption, greater use of RES and avoided CO2 emissions."
Croatia,"This program is as a continuation of the implementation of the Program of energy renovation of apartment buildings from the period from 2014 to 2020. For this purpose, it is necessary to plan funds from the ESI (European Structural and Investment) Funds for the next programming period 2021-2027 (with implementation by 2030), while implementation procedures need to be significantly simplified, especially in public procurement implementation. The technical conditions should also remain as in the existing Program. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the thermal needs of the building by at least 50%. It is necessary to encourage that renovation is performed according to the nZEB (Nearly Zero Energy Building) standard. In addition, establishing a special fund from which costs will be reimbursed to energy-poor households or households at risk of energy poverty should be considered, in order to remove the obstacle of securing a sufficient number of co-owners' consents for energy recovery. The implementation of the Program must be accompanied by strong promotional activities, while technical assistance should be provided to applicants. It is necessary to ensure energy consumption monitoring before and after energy renovation, for which it is necessary to create preconditions within the EMIS (Energy Management Information System). The plan includes the renovation of around 520,000 m2 of apartment buildings per year."
Croatia,"The program should be conceived as a continuation of the implementation of the Program for energy renovation of family houses from the period from 2014 to 2020, with co-financing from the Environmental Protection and Energy Efficiency Fund. The program should leave the possibility of implementing individual measures, with respect to the order of implementation of measures (e.g. the replacement of a heating system with a more efficient system that uses RES should only be possible for those houses that have good thermal characteristics and do not need enclosure interventions). It is necessary to strongly encourage the renovation according to the nZEB standard. The implementation of the Program must be accompanied by strong promotional activities. The plan includes the renovation of around 350,000 m2 of family houses per year."
Croatia,"The measure is based on the Programme for the Energy Renovation of Public Buildings for the Period from 2014 to 2015. For this purpose, it is necessary to plan funds from the ESI (European Structural and Investment) Funds for the next programming period 2021-2027 (with implementation by 2030). Funds need to be planned to ensure both the activation of private capital and the ESCO (Energy Service Company) market, especially for buildings that are suitable for such financing models (buildings with continuous work, such as hospitals, penitentiaries, homes for the elderly, etc.) and belonging to the category of central government buildings. Market models need to be combined with grants in order to achieve nZEB (Nearly Zero Energy Building) standards. For buildings that are not suitable for market models, it is necessary to provide grants under the same conditions as in the previous program. Renovation of public sector buildings needs to be directed towards the nZEB standard wherever technically feasible. The plan includes the renovation of around 350,000 m2 of public buildings per year."

The Commission makes recommendations to the Government of the Republic of Croatia on overall policies and measures for climate change mitigation and adaptation and provides political support in the implementation of climate change mitigation and adaptation policies and measures. The Commission also proposes to the Government of the Republic of Croatia the adoption of acts of strategic planning and regulations related to policies and measures for climate change mitigation and adaptation, proposes objectives, measures and activities of public policies and monitors their effects and outcomes in implementation and provides proposals and support in promoting interdisciplinary and synergistic public policy goals, measures and activities. Members of the Commission, the tasks and the manner of work of the Commission shall be determined by the Government of the Republic of Croatia at the proposal of the Ministry responsible for environmental protection."
Croatia,"Protected buildings in terms of the Energy Renovation Programme of buildings that have the status of cultural property are those that can be classified into two categories: individually protected cultural property (individual building and construction complexes) and buildings located within the protected cultural and historical ensemble. The program does not include buildings protected as a preventively protected cultural property, or buildings registered as cultural property. Two basic approaches to energy renovation of buildings that are the subject of this Programme have been developed: a complete (integrated) approach and an approach with the application of individual energy renovation measures."
Croatia,"Energy renovation of public lighting in the Republic of Croatia is currently being carried out using ESI (European Structural and Investment) Funds from the European Regional Development Fund. Given the significant potential that exists in public lighting systems, it is planned to use ESI Funds in the next programming period from 2021 to 2027. By programming a larger allocation of funds for this purpose, the existing potential could be used by the end of 2030, which is estimated at around 225-280 GWh. At the same time, the renovation of public lighting would meet the technical standards for road lighting, which means that traffic safety would be improved and light pollution would be reduced. The financing models that will be used in the next period should also enable the mobilization of private capital through energy services or public-private partnerships, in order to achieve the best possible multiplier effect. Models that are to be considered include interest rate subsidies on commercial loans/required returns to the service provider and guarantees, while it is necessary to provide grants for projects requiring investment in new public lighting infrastructure (poles, additional luminaires, etc.) to meet standard lighting requirements."
Croatia,"The public sector in Croatia is obliged to systematically manage energy, which is specifically regulated by the Energy Efficiency Act (OG 127/2014, 116/2018, 25/2020, 41/2021), or the Ordinance on Systematic Energy Management (OG 18/2015, 6/2016). The basis of this measure is an Information System for Energy Management (ISGE). The goal is to include and regularly monitor with ISGE all public sector buildings and public lighting systems by the end of 2030."
Croatia,"Although large companies are obliged to conduct regular energy audits, this obligation does not ensure continuous care for energy consumption in the company nor does it cover small and medium-sized enterprises. In order to encourage companies to introduce certified energy management systems (such as ISO 50001), a comprehensive analysis of the possibilities of using the tax system (including taxes and parafiscal levies) will be made to encourage companies to introduce such a system and thus ensure continuous care for energy consumption."
Croatia,"One of the basic measures of informing consumers is the legal obligation of suppliers for submitting to consumers at least once a year information invoices, which contain information on energy billing and previous consumption of the end customer for billing meters that are the subject of the contract, which include comparison with average regular consumption or reference customer from the same category. It is desirable to reduce the frequency of application of this legal provision from the annual level to the monthly level, and it is absolutely necessary to ensure that the energy regulatory body monitors these obligations of energy suppliers. In addition, based on these regulations, it is necessary to further inform consumers about the content and meaning of bills, which is the task of the National Coordination Body for Energy Efficiency."
Croatia,"Informing the general public and target groups will be carried out by organizing targeted info-campaigns related to specific programs to promote energy efficiency, especially energy renovation of buildings. National Coordination Body for Energy Efficiency will maintain a national energy efficiency portal and ensure continuous promotion of energy efficiency and energy services through the provision of up-to-date information. In the next period, special attention should be given to informing consumers about the duties of the supplier within the system of obligations."
Croatia,"Training will be achieved through the continued implementation of the existing measure and the adaptation of activities to the needs and the real situation. It is especially important to work systematically on attracting young people to construction and other technical occupations, which will in the long run contribute to the availability of professional capacities for the implementation of energy renovation of buildings, which is the basis for achieving energy and climate goals. Through education in the field of energy efficiency, the principles of green building will be set and applied: it is necessary to encourage the promotion and implementation of green building (construction according to the principles of sustainability) as an important segment of sustainable development and the circular economy."
Croatia,"An important characteristic of the Croatian transmission network, both in terms of plant safety and support of market activities, and in terms of losses is the extremely strong connection with neighbouring power systems (interconnections). While on the one hand this significantly increases the security of the plant, on the other hand due to transit the network losses increase. In the period until 2030, measures related to the management of the power system and measures related to the development of the transmission network will continue to be implemented, for optimal (safe and efficient) management of the facility."
Croatia,"In the period until 2030, activities will continue to reduce technical and non-technical losses in the electricity distribution network. A detailed analysis will determine the causes of increased losses in certain parts of the network and priorities for the implementation of activities to reduce technical and non-technical losses. Based on the experience from the implementation of the pilot project of introducing advanced networks in pilot areas with the use of ESI (European Structural and Investment) Funds, it is necessary to program the continuation of the use of ESI Funds in the next programming period from 2021 to 2027 for further development of advanced networks."
Croatia,"In the existing large centralized heating systems, a large source of losses is the deteriorated steam and hot water network, and this measure foresees the continuation of the replacement of deteriorated steel hot water pipes and steam lines with new pre-insulated pipes and a technological shift to fourth-generation district heating. In smaller systems with their own boiler room, it is necessary to enable the reconstruction of boiler rooms, in particular by replacing them with high-efficiency cogeneration systems or systems using heat pumps. The measure also envisages the development of new heating and cooling systems, which use high-efficiency cogeneration or renewable energy sources."
Croatia,"The potential for increasing the energy efficiency of the gas transport system is largest in the consumption of natural gas, which is mostly (70%) consumed for preheating natural gas before delivery to customers, and only a small part (30%) for heating business premises and various technological reliefs, i.e. system exhaust. Activities to improve energy efficiency will be implemented in accordance with the Ten-Year Development Plan of the Gas Transport System of the Republic of Croatia 2018-2027."
Croatia,"Dissemination of information to the general public and target groups will be conducted through the organization of targeted informational campaigns related to investments in systems using renewable energy sources, especially in systems for own needs. Information, education and capacity building for the use of RES will be provided at the national level."
Croatia,"Defining guidelines and criteria for the regulation of specific spatial-functional elements for the use of RES, more advanced and cross-sectoral harmonization of spatial planning conditions for determining areas suitable for the construction of RES plants at the state, county and local level. Guidelines and criteria for determining the spatial planning conditions for the use of space intended for the construction of facilities for energy recovery of RES (specific spatial-functional elements in space) and for the exploitation fields of geothermal water for energy purposes will be adopted. Conditions for determining locations and construction of RES plants will be integrated into spatial plans at the state, county and local levels."
Croatia,Providing financial incentives for the development of projects for the use of RES for the production of electricity and heat. Encouraging the use of RES for electricity and heat production will be implemented at the national level.
Croatia,The existing legal framework needs to be amended and procedures and practices developed. The goal is to fully adopt the regulatory framework and established procedures at the national level by the end of 2023.
Croatia,"The overarching measure to increase energy security is the integrated planning of security of supply in the context of all energy products and all energy systems. Integrated planning should be harmonized at the local, regional and national level, and in accordance with energy planning carried out by energy entities for energy infrastructure throughout the territory of the Republic of Croatia. In addition, integrated planning needs to be aligned with planning for alternative fuels and infrastructure for alternative fuels."
Croatia,"In order to increase the energy storage capacity of the system and increase the regulatory capacity of the electricity system, it is planned to build additional reversible power plants with a capacity of 150 MW before 2030, development of heat storage tanks for end customers, batteries, charging stations for electric vehicles that allow energy storage, and the use of other innovative energy storage technologies."
Croatia,"Centralised thermal systems have been identified as one of the priorities of the energy policy of the Republic of Croatia. The most significant potential for the development and improvement of existing centralised thermal systems is primarily to increase the energy efficiency of production units, infrastructure and equipment at end-users and to increase reliability and security of supply. Therefore, this measure envisages the maintenance and upgrading of existing CTS systems, stopping the trend of disconnecting customers from the CTS systems, introducing heat storage tanks powered by electricity, and using RES for CTS as well as replacing existing CTS production with renewable sources (e.g. biofuels) and use of heat pumps."
Croatia,"The size of the liquefied natural gas terminal depends on the interest of market. In the first phase, the construction of the FSRU vessel (Floating Storage Regasification Unit) is planned, whose maximum annual natural gas supply will amount up to 2.6 billion cubic meters. The planned maximum capacity of natural gas supply from the terminal, and indirectly its size and capacity, is conditioned by the maximum capacity of the gas pipeline system."
Croatia,"Implementation of investments in modernization and improvement of production for maintaining the competitiveness of refineries.
The measure includes the implementation of the modernization of the existing infrastructure so that the techniques of extraction, transshipment and construction of a transport network with very low fugitive emissions can be applied during the oil and gas extraction process and in transshipment and transport.
Also, the measure contributes to better capacity utilization of existing refineries."
Croatia,"Increasing energy efficiency is achieved by implementing measures that contribute to reducing energy intensity through more rational use of energy and raw materials, by adding additives and by altering production processes and equipment at pumping stations and refineries, which contributes to reducing fugitive emissions."
Croatia,In Croatia except of flaring in natural gas and oil production and processing venting of CH4 emissions exists as well. Planned measure is that all places for venting should be replaced with torches. In that way CH4 will be flared not released in atmosphere as CH4 and methane emissions will be reduced by 95-99% depending on the efficiency of the torches.
Croatia,"Croatian Transmission System Operator ltd. is, according to the Energy Act (OG 120/2012, 14/2014, 95/2015, 102/2015, 68/2018), an energy entity responsible for the management, operation and guidance, maintenance, development and construction of the transmission electricity network. According to the Electricity Market Act (OG 111/2021), the Croatian Transmission System Operator, as the owner of the 110 kV to 400 kV transmission network, is obliged to develop and adopt ten-year, three-year and one-year investment plans for the development of the transmission network. Ten-year development plans are update annually. At the time of writing, the Ten-Year Transmission Network Development Plan 2019-2028 was relevant, with detailed elaboration for the initial three-year and one-year periods."
Croatia,"Transmission system development planning is carried out through the preparation of the Ten-Year Gas Transmission System Development Plan, the development of which is the responsibility of the gas transmission system operator pursuant to the Gas Market Act (OG 18/18, 23/20). The gas transmission system operator is the company Plinacro ltd. Ten-year plans for the development of the gas transmission system are update on an annual basis. At the time of writing, the Ten-Year Plan for the Development of the Gas Transport System of the Republic of Croatia 2018-2027 was relevant."
Croatia,"In order to enable the active role of network users in the electricity market, it is necessary to amend the existing regulatory framework in an appropriate manner, especially through the introduction of aggregators as market participants and through enabling the launch of a pilot project to provide ancillary services. Pilot projects will analyse in detail the services that users can provide to the distribution or transmission system operator. Possible types, scope, method and period of providing ancillary services will be analysed. Barriers to the use of ancillary services will be identified and ways to remove them will be suggested. Previously, an analysis of the potential for the provision of ancillary services and flexibility services with the response of consumption by network users will be conducted, based on which the method and model of providing ancillary services and the response of consumption by network users will be defined."
Croatia,"In order to enable further development of energy markets and the active role of consumers in energy markets, advanced metering devices and systems at consumption level will be introduced."
Croatia,"Within the Programme for Energy Poverty Reduction, capacity building will be continued through local info centres, and energy poor citizens as well as citizens at risk of energy poverty will be provided with adequate information and advice on energy efficiency measures that contribute to the reduction of energy poverty and on opportunities of cofinancing activities in this area. Furthermore, indicators necessary to monitor the energy poverty will be identified and a monitoring system will be established through the already existing system for collecting data on household consumption and habits. On the basis of data, a possible extension of criteria for gaining the status of vulnerable energy customers will be analysed. Also, the implementation of energy efficiency measures in energy poor households will be co-financed, such as replacement of household appliances by ìold for newî system, upgrade or replacement of heating systems with systems that are environmentally and economically more favourable and more energy-efficient, and above all, with systems that use renewable energy sources, and the implementation of other technical energy efficiency measures will also be cofinanced. 
A model to cover energy costs will be developed and implemented within the Programme. The model will determine the level of assistance needed for households facing the problem of meeting energy costs, based on the amount of energy required to meet the minimum standard of living."
Croatia,"Pursuant to the Ordinance on Availability of Information on Fuel Economy and CO2 Emissions from Passenger Cars (OG 7/15) each supplier of new passenger cars intended for sale shall provide consumers with information on the fuel consumption rate and specific CO2 emission of passenger cars. Central body of state administration responsible for the road traffic safety, on the basis of the Ordinance once a year, not later than 31 March of the current year, makes a Guidelines on cost-effectiveness of fuel consumption and CO2 emission from new passenger cars available for purchase on the market in the Republic of Croatia. The Guidelines contains required information for each model of new passenger cars available in the domestic market. Extension of information to other categories of motorized road vehicles will be implemented within the measure."
Croatia,"The existing system of payment of a special environmental fee for motor vehicles is regulated by the Act on the Environmental Protection and Energy Efficiency Fund (OG 107/03, 144/12), and the Regulation on unit charges, corrective coefficients and detailed criteria and standards to determine the special environmental fee for motor vehicles (OG 114/14, 147/14, 2/21). The special fee is charged taking into consideration the type of engine and fuel, engine operating volume, type of vehicle, CO2 emissions and vehicleís age."
Croatia,"Based on the ëpolluter paysí principle, the modelís calculation is based on CO2 emissions into the air from motor vehicles. The special tax is determined on the basis of the sales or market price of the motor vehicle, CO2 emissions expressed in grams per kilometer, engine volume in cubic centimeters and the level of greenhouse gas emissions. This special tax encourages the purchase of energy efficient vehicles and vehicles with lower greenhouse gas emissions. The implementation of the measure is ensured through the enactment of the Act on Special Tax on Motor Vehicles (OG 15/13, 108/13, 115/16, 127/17, 121/19)."
Croatia,"IIn accordance with the Act on Climate Change and Ozone Layer Protection (OG 127/2019) supplier that places the fuel on domestic market shall monitor greenhouse gas emissions per energy unit in the lifetime of the fuel. Suppliers have to draw up a report that has to be verified and submitted to the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development - the Institute for Environment and Nature.
The Croatian Government's Regulation on the quality of liquid petroleum fuels (OG 131/2021) regulates the limit values of components and/or quality characteristics of liquid petroleum fuels, method of determining and monitoring the quality of liquid petroleum fuels, conditions for the operation of sampling laboratories and laboratory analysis of the quality of liquid petroleum fuels, the way of demonstrating compliance of the product, the name and marking of the product, way and deadlines for the submission of reports on the quality of liquid petroleum fuels and emissions reports of greenhouse gases in the lifetime of fuels and energy, method of monitoring and reporting, methodology for calculation of greenhouse gas emissions in lifetime of fuels and energy, methodology for calculating the contribution of electric road vehicles to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the format of the report, the period of the storage and the manner of transmission of data to the European Union competent bodies."
Croatia,"Through amendments to laws and bylaws, ensure the development of infrastructure for alternative fuels, raising the share of renewable sources in direct energy consumption in transport and promoting clean and energy efficient vehicles in road transport."
Croatia,"Incorporates estimated mitigation potential of measures in the general consumption sector in WAM scenario.
Description is given for each measure separately."
Croatia,"In the context of co-financing cleaner transport projects, it is necessary to define special co-financing lines for specific purposes, namely, for the purchase of electric vehicles, compressed and liquefied natural gas and hydrogen. Incentives for co-financing the purchase of vehicles will be primarily oriented towards alternative fuels for which the assessment of the existing situation has shown a minor representation in the total number of vehicles and will be time-limited until the minimum representation of vehicles is achieved. The minimum degree of market development shall be considered to be 1% of alternative fuel vehicles in the total number of vehicles registered in the country."
Croatia,"The objective of this measure is to facilitate the uptake of alternative fuels by users/consumers by strengthening the alternative fuels distribution infrastructure and implementing common technical specifications for this infrastructure. This measure will not directly affect the reduction of fuel consumption in traffic, but the development of infrastructure is certainly a necessary prerequisite for the development of the market of vehicles and vessels that use electricity, compressed and liquefied natural gas and hydrogen in Croatia.
The incentive measures for infrastructure co-financing will be primarily oriented towards alternative fuels for which an assessment of the current situation has shown that the infrastructure is underdeveloped and will be limited in time until the situation monitoring shows minimal infrastructure coverage."
Croatia,"The measure is regulated by the Act on Combined Transport of Goods (OG 120/16) and the Ordinance on Incentives in Combined Transport of Goods (OG 5/18), which stipulates incentives for combined transport of goods by rail, inland waters or sea, and incentives for combined transport of goods on road sections."
Croatia,"The measure follows the general and specific objectives defined in the Transport Development Strategy of the Republic of Croatia for the period from 2017 to 2030 (OG 84/17) in the context of energy efficiency of rail, road, maritime transport, inland waterway transport and urban, suburban and regional traffic. Development of rail and generally multimodal infrastructure fall behind in comparison to highway infrastructure in terms of quality and connectivity. Investments are planned to develop a sustainable, integrated trans-European climate-resilient transport network. In maritime and inland waterway transport, the possibilities of introducing appropriate mechanisms to ensure the transition to low-carbon solutions will be analysed, especially in terms of the application of alternative energy sources for navigation. In this context, an action plan for shipping will be defined, which will, among other things, define appropriate emission standards for the coming period. Also, in air transport, the Republic of Croatia will define a plan and develop detailed guidelines for achieving a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions."
Croatia,"It is necessary to promote sustainable development of urban transport systems through the optimization of logistics of transport of goods and intelligent management of public parking spaces (ICT technologies), introduction of integrated passenger transport, introduction of car-sharing schemes in cities, introduction of low-emission zones in cities, introduction of public city bicycles system and construction of the accompanying cycling infrastructure, intelligent traffic control (upgrade, adaptation and replacement of out of date signalling devices and equipment, installation of advanced traffic equipment and intelligent traffic lights equipped with the autonomous power supply system from renewable sources, constructing and equipping central operating centers for monitoring and management of intersections with installed traffic lights). At the local level, it is necessary to continuously prepare and implement Sustainable Mobility Plans in cities, as well as strategic plans that build on the existing planning practices, and take into account integration, participation and evaluation principles to meet the citizens' mobility needs now and in the future, and ensure better quality of life in cities and their surroundings. The activities will be accompanied by appropriate information and educational campaigns."
Croatia,"The aim of the measure is to raise awareness of the benefits of energy efficient driving. Education on the eco-driving elements is carried out in short trainings among the drivers who received their driver's license prior to the entry into force of the Ordinance on Training of Driver's License Candidates (OG 132/17, 6/18, 102/20), which introduced an obligation for all driving schools and instructors to carry out training on the elements of eco-driving during the standard training of candidates. Special elements of the national campaign should be devoted to eco-driving education for drivers of passenger cars, buses, commercial and heavy-duty vehicles."
Croatia,"In accordance with the ""National Coastal Shipping Service Development Plan"" and considering that the Republic of Croatia is a maritime land with developed longitudinal liner traffic, and in addition has navigable river routes and lakes, this measure would co-finance the projects of gradual transition of the existing obsolete fleet to alternative and/or hybrid solutions and new construction. Ships that use alternative fuels are generally more expensive than ships that use conventional fuels, so there is no expressed interest of shipowners to invest in such ships. Therefore, in the initial period it is necessary to financially support the conversion/construction of such ships to the extent that the purchase price is equalized or puts such a shipowner in the same position as a shipowner that uses ships with conventional fuel."
Croatia,"Increasing the share of RES in transport by 2030 through the development of the advanced fuels market and achieving the planned share of advanced fuels in direct energy consumption in transport through the criteria of the lowest cost and the largest multiplier. The implementation of the measure is based on amendments to relevant laws and bylaws based on the Directive on the Promotion of the Use of Energy from Renewable Sources, and in particular the establishment of conditions for monitoring the sustainability of biofuels and greenhouse gas savings."
Croatia,"Measure includes gradual substitution of clinker with alternative materials in cement production which leads to reduction in clinker production. The share of used clinker substitutes depends on the composition of other raw materials used, availability of materials of appropriate composition on the market and market requirements for cements of certain composition."
Croatia,"In accordance with the Regulation (EU) 517/2014 the measure defines activities and procedures for the prevention of fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions, conducting equipment leakage checks, use of equipment with leak detection systems, keeping records of equipment on which leakage checks need to be performed, collection of fluorinated greenhouse gases to ensure their recycling, reclamation or destruction, the development of a producer responsibility system for the collection of fluorinated greenhouse gases and their recycling, reclamation or destruction, and the implementation of training and certification programs."
Croatia,"Incorporates estimated mitigation potential of measures in the transport sector in WAM scenario.
Description is given for each measure separately."
Croatia,"The measure concerns the gradual limitation of the amount of fluorocarbons available on the EU market by 2030 to 21% of the total amount of fluorocarbons placed on the market during the reference period 2009 to 2012, as established by Regulation (EU) 517/2014.
Regulation (EU) 517/2014 introduces a quota system for placing fluorocarbons on the market. The calculation of the benchmarks and the allocation of quotas should be based on the reported quantities of fluorocarbons placed on the market during the reference period from 2009 to 2012. Quota for placing fluorocarbons on the market shall be allocated to each manufacturer and importer for each year, starting in 2015, on the basis of benchmarks, applying defined percentages to calculate the maximum amount of fluorocarbons to be placed on the market and the allocation mechanism."
Croatia,"The measure concerns restrictions and prohibitions on the placing on the market of certain products and equipment containing fluorinated greenhouse gases, as laid down in Regulation (EU) 517/2014.
Fluorinated greenhouse gases with high greenhouse potential are limited for use in new refrigeration and air conditioning equipment, fire extinguishing systems, foam blowing agents and aerosols."
Croatia,Directive 2006/40/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 relating to emissions from air-conditioning systems in motor vehicles and amending Council Directive 70/156/EEC has been implemented in three phases. The last phase came into force on 1 January 2017 by limiting the possibility of retrofitting air conditioning equipment designed to contain fluorinated greenhouse gases with a global warming potential above 150 in motor vehicles and banning the charging of air conditioning equipment with these gases.
Croatia,"Waste prevention is achieved through the process of reuse and the use of by-products and the repealing of waste status, which will directly affect the reduction of the total amount of waste. The implementation of waste prevention measures is defined by the Waste Prevention Plan and the Plan for the Prevention and Reduction of Food Waste in the Republic of Croatia 2019 - 2022 (OG 61/19). The most important measures in terms of waste prevention are the establishment of Centres for reuse and provision of the necessary equipment for home composting as well educational activities.
This measure is achieved by cleaner production, education, economic instruments and enforcement of regulations in waste management, and by investing in modern technologies that enable material recovery and chemical recycling of waste. According to the Act, quantitative targets and deadlines for reducing the total amount of waste disposed to non-compliant landfills were defined. Disposal of waste to non-compliant landfills in Croatia was prohibited after 31 December 2017."
Croatia,"Beside the Sustainable Waste Management Act, the Waste Management Plan of the Republic of Croatia for the period 2017 ñ 2022 (OG 3/17, 1/22) also defines the quantitative targets and deadlines for increasing the amount of separately collected and recycled waste.
Waste management objectives are prescribed to encourage the transition to a European circular economy with a high level of resource efficiency, in which the value of products, materials and resources is maintained for as long as possible, and waste generation is reduced to a minimum."
Croatia,"The Ordinance on the Methods and Conditions for the Landfill of Waste, Categories and Operational Requirements for Waste Landfills (OG 114/15, 103/18, 56/19) and Ordinance on Waste Management (OG 106/22) regulate technical requirements for landfill operation, which reduce possible adverse effects of landfills on the environment. At landfills where landfill gas occurs it is necessary to secure a gas collection system, and that gas must be treated and used. If collected landfill gases cannot be used for energy production, they should be flared in the area of the landfill and the emission of methane into the atmosphere should be prevented."
Croatia,"The aim of this measure is to reduce the amount of biodegradable fraction of waste disposed at landfills, thus reducing methane emissions resulting from anaerobic decomposition of waste. 
Pursuant to the Sustainable Waste Management Act, quantitative targets that relate to the reduction of biodegradable municipal waste disposed to landfills were established. Thus, by the end of 2020, the share of biodegradable municipal waste disposed of in landfills had to be reduced to 35% weight of biodegradable municipal waste generated in 1997, that is 264,661 tons of waste was allowed to dispose. To prevent the disposal of biowaste at landfills and contribute to the achievement of other goals of waste management, it is necessary to encourage citizens to compost. The goal is to achieve that households separate biowaste from other municipal waste by disposing of it in biowaste containers. This measure will cover rural areas, i.e. suburbs of urban areas with a larger number of independent housing units with infield. In the territory of the Republic of Croatia, by implementing this measure, it is possible to reduce up to 90,000 tons of biowaste per year."
Croatia,The measure is associated with measures for promoting the use of renewable energy sources for electricity and heat generation and obligation to use renewable energy sources in transport and refers to the mandatory use of biowaste as a substrate in biogas plants that produce biogas to be used for the biomethane production and electricity and heat generation.
Croatia,"Specific sub-measures within this group of measures related to the regulation of digestive processes of livestock and their nutrition: changing the ratio of certain types of feed in the diet, the use of supplements, improving the quality of forage and improving grazing systems. These measures are largely related to the potential reduction of methane emissions from intestinal fermentation."
Croatia,"By improving and changing existing manure management systems and using the best available techniques, it is possible to reduce emissions.
Activities involved within this measure relate to development programs to increase the share of implementation:
1) Manipulation of nutrient content and their relationship in the meal:
- reduction of protein content in the meal
- A high-fiber meal
- reduction of grazing intensity
2) Changes in the manure system (type of manure) and improvement of manure collection facilities:
- Application of a manure system in pig breeding, which is characterized by a short time from the moment of defecation or urination to the moment of removal of feces and urine from buildings
3) Measures during manure storage:
- Reduction of storage / disposal time on manure 
4) Improvements to manure management facilities:
- Manure tanks must be watertight and meet the size of the manure collection for a six-month period.
- Increasing the energy efficiency of housing
- Project for improvement of the system for calculation of greenhouse gas emissions (development of nationally specific emission factors and parameters)"
Croatia,"Measures that achieve effects on reducing greenhouse gas emissions refer to measures that increase the intensity of production per animal and per unit time.
In Croatia, the problem is that unused pastures and meadows cover a large area of ??agricultural land. In order to reduce costs, extensive fattening on pastures is becoming increasingly important. Numerous variables are included in determining the number of animals (conditional head / ha) that can be on pasture without causing damage to natural resources: soil, climate, plant composition, species and age of livestock, water availability, sensitive areas (too steep) , endangered species, wetlands, etc.), general soil condition and types of livestock production.
Given the import of a large number of calves for fattening or fattened cattle and meat, the establishment of a cow-calf system imposes itself as a logical solution and source of calves that can later be fed on the same farms (pasture fattening) or fattened in specialized fattening farms. Thus, work on establishing and encouraging a cow-calf breeding system is the principal actity in this measure, with the Agricultural Census being a method on providing feedback on the rate of implementation."
Croatia,"The introduction of biogas plants reduces methane emissions due to the use of litter as a renewable source for electricity production. The measure is linked to the measures in Renewable sources in the production of electricity and heat and Construction of cogeneration plants from the Energy sector. Anaerobic breakdown help biogas plants to reduce the source of easily degradable carbon in the manure that is applied to agricultural land, but it also potentially reduces the process of nitrification and N2O emissions."
Croatia,"Main activity in this measure is research aimed at determining the variation in the predicted CH4 emission and determining the genetic potential for reducing methane emissions in dairy cows as well as increased production intensity.
Genetic potential and type of individuals (breeding and selection work) - Intensive selection to increase productivity - higher production achieves indirect effects -  fewer animals and less food consumption . Furthermore, higher food utilization results in reduced excretion of N compounds in faeces and urine, but also reduces excretion and thus their potential emission. A positive genetic correlation between PME (predicted methane emissions) and RFI (residual feed intake) shows that cows with lower RFI also have lower potential emissions. Thus, it is possible to reduce methane production in cows by selecting genetically more suitable cows with respect to methane emissions. Genetic variability assumes a reduction of 11-26% over a ten-year period, but can also be increased by applying a selection program. However, there are several doubts, such as the lack of accurate methane measurements (and the main assumption is that methane produced per unit of food does not affect RFI levels), as well as predicting the possible consequences of genetic selection. To overcome these limitations, it is necessary to collect data on feed intake and methane emissions in dairy cows, health status and mortality rate, duration of the production cycle."
Croatia,"Reduced tillage is the result of scientific research and practical audits that result in changing the conventional tillage system by reducing tillage depth, omitting one or more operations, reducing the frequency or complete omission of tillage, reducing the cultivated area and retaining crop residues. The direct impact on greenhouse gas emissions is primarily related to the significant impact on the organic carbon content in the soil and the smaller number of operating hours of machines."
Croatia,"Sowing leguminous crops binds atmospheric nitrogen, reduces the risk of groundwater pollution, the soil is enriched with organic matter, which has multiple positive effects on improving and maintaining favorable physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil.
Principal activities under this meausure are commencements of multi-year research on the impact of practiced crop rotations on changes in soil characteristics (expected duration> 10 years).
Measure should be implemented by encouraging producers to increase the share of leguminous crops when creating crop rotation, using incentives."
Croatia,"By sowing intermediate crops that can be used for livestock feeding or plowing for green manure, the remaining nutrients will be used, prevent further evaporation of water from the soil, reduce carbon loss from the soil, prevent nitrogen leaching into groundwater and increase organic matter in the soil.
Goal of this PaM is introducing changes in organic matter content / increase in soil carbon sequestration and decrease in nitrate seepage by sowing intermediate crops . The principles of good agricultural practice in the protection of soil and water from nitrates recommend the introduction of intercrops (intercropping crops) between the harvest of the main crops. 
Activities include:
 -investigations of the impact of crop application on changes in soil characteristics.
- Encouraging the use of a typical winter or spring crop for fodder use as an intermediate crop, through incentives."
Croatia,"Reducing the consumption of mineral fertilizers is an indirect benefit from other measures that reduce the need for their application, but with proper fertilization practice. In addition, the application of slow-release fertilizers can directly affect the total amount of mineral fertilizers applied.
Activites include:
- Introduction of information technologies, remote sensing with application in agriculture, and production of soil fertility maps
- Works on the establishment of systems for real monitoring of the consumption of mineral fertilizers on farms and realized yields
- Improving the system for calculating greenhouse gas emissions"
Croatia,"Organic fertilizers originate from organic sources such as solid manure or slurry and plant or animal residues, and strongly stimulate the activity of soil microbes compared to mineral fertilizers. Using injectors for direct injection into the soil reduces nitrogen loss due to volatilization.
Activites include:
- Introduction of information technologies, remote sensing with application in agriculture, and production of soil fertility maps
- Monitoring of soil changes in different ways of using and applying organic fertilizers
- Encouraging investment in direct soil injection systems
- Consolidation of agricultural land"
Croatia,"Agroforestry is a common name for land management systems in which permanent woody species are integrated with the cultivation of crops and/or animals on the same surface unit. Some agroforestry systems (e.g. Agro-silvopastoral system) are significant carbon removals. Experiments are required to determine applicability in Croatia with regard to different land use forms and different needs. It is important to point out that some elements from agroforestry were recorded throughout history in the coastal and coastal area of Croatia: cultivation and cultivation of land on terraces that were used to raise perennial plantations, olive groves, vineyards, various fruit trees and could be used for limited livestock.
Activities include:
- Research of possibilities of application of agroforestry with focus on identification of suitable areas"
Croatia,"The construction of drainage, irrigation and protection systems against floods, droughts and other natural disasters can indirectly reduce nutrient losses due to seepage and leaching, resulting in a reduced need for nitrogen application. In addition to the controlled application of mineral fertilizers, controlled drainage, reuse of drained water and the use of water of appropriate quality are important for reducing nitrate emissions. Drainage has the function of draining excess water. Also, the change in soil-air ratios affects the activity of beneficial microorganisms.
Activites include:
- research programs to improve the properties of existing hydromelioration systems
- construction of irrigation systems
- staff education"
Croatia,"Encouraging development, education and implementation of technologies at a national and regional level, encouraging the transition and adaptation of the entire production chain to produce new crops or enabling and encouraging the implementation of cultivars and varieties that are more resistant to drought and disease and have a lower overall carbon footprint. Aimed at reducing the need for mineral nitrogen in new cultivars that have increased resistance and less need for nutrients, as well as in specific legumes that have the ability to symbiotic relationship with nodule bacteria."
Croatia,"Growing cereals for animal feed produces much more greenhouse gases than producing cereals for human consumption. By reducing the consumption of meat (especially red) in the diet in favor of foods of plant origin, significant reductions in emissions can be achieved, as well as water savings.
The first step with this PaM is research on the current eating habits of the population of the Republic of Croatia.
Activity:
- Statistical and nutritional research of eating habits of the population of the Republic of Croatia by regions"
Croatia,"Energy utilization of post-harvest residues (with emphasis on field crops) is one of the most important ways of producing energy from biomass in the Republic of Croatia. Other possible sources are the remnants of the winter harvest of almost all horticultural species, as well as fast-growing crops for energy production that are planted/sown exclusively for the production of biomass with the aim of its conversion into energy. The establishment of collection and logistics centers for biomass with the use of existing infrastructure (utilities, competence centers, business zones) will reduce the unit cost of production of biomass products and capitalize on innovation capacity and necessary equipment for innovative biomass products for the bioeconomy. Collection and logistics centers will act as a link between the farmer who owns biomass, processing biomass into new products with higher added value, developing new products and placing these new products on the market. The locations of the Centers will be defined with long-term development policies, in order to minimize their carbon footprint."
Croatia,"The calculation of emissions/removals in the LULUCF sector, and sectoral projects (implementation activities) should form the basis for planning the use and management of LULUCF land categories for each of the repositories. The development of a Land Management Strategy is implied in order to properly define further (sub) measures that will be implemented on a particular category of land and which will reduce emissions and increase the removal of greenhouse gases in the Republic of Croatia. Proposed future measures should form an integral part of this strategy. The measure aims to increase carbon sequestration in the LULUCF sector, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and align EU targets for increasing the share of energy from renewable sources with emission reduction requirements."
Croatia,"The measure will contribute to maintaining/increasing removals in the forestry sector and meet the provisions of Decision 529/2013/EU and Regulation 841/2018/EU. Implementation of activities that contribute to increasing the carbon stock content in forests, especially in biomass storage, and the implementation of which ensures removals in a certain period higher than those defined by the Forest Reference Level (FRL). These activities are, for example, the analysis of the current management method and suggestions for improvement, reforestation, transfer of stands to a higher form of cultivation, selection of species for filling, etc. Maintaining removals higher than those defined by the FRL also ensures an increase in emission allowances that can be transferred to sectors outside the ETS."
Croatia,"Changes in the sinks of greenhouse gases as a result of direct land use change caused by human activities and forestry activities, limited since 1990 to afforestation, reforestation and clearing, are allowed to be calculated in the national balance of emissions and sinks of greenhouse gases and used to fulfil obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. By analysing the costs and benefits of afforestation on the new areas, possibility of increasing greenhouse gas sinks using reforestation activities on the barren productive forest floor will be investigated. This would justify introduction of possible incentive measures, such as the afforestation of fast-growing species and natural regeneration of forests, equivalent to measures for greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Due to the regulations in the field of nature protection which regulate the establishment of Natura 2000 areas, Croatia is not able to dispose of all grassland areas (according to the national regulation: non-overgrown productive forest land) for afforestation purposes. Given that in the Republic of Croatia there are agricultural areas where no production takes place and which have been neglected for many years, when drafting the Land Management Strategy, the problem of these areas must be adequately addressed."
Croatia,"It is necessary to encourage the use of wood in traditional and new products, and to take awareness of the importance of wood products as carbon storage, and their importance in terms of additionally avoided emissions when the use of these products avoids emissions from the production of for instance plastic products. Raising information on manufactured wood products leads to data harmonization, which enables the creating the basis for the adoption of strategic plans, promoting the use of wood products, educating about the importance of wood products and their impact on climate and environment."
Croatia,"Agricultural production should be performed in a way that contributes to emission factor reduction, which is in the interest of family farms, given that the CAP EC regulations increase the amount of incentives if the emission factor is lower due to the way of land management. Management practices for these areas that may have an impact on emissions and removals, for example in soil storage: tillage methods, lifetime of plantation/crop (rotation period) and plantation/crop type, fertilizer application, residue management, erosion control, irrigation system application etc. It is also necessary to promote land management activities in a way suitable for the climate and the environment."
Croatia,"In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by changing and increasing removal, it is necessary to analyse the management of grassland areas in the Republic of Croatia. Implementing pasture management activities in a way that contributes to reducing the emission factor is of interest to family farms, given that the CAP EC regulations increase the amount of incentives if the emission factor is lower due to the management of these areas. It is also necessary to promote land management activities in a way suitable for the climate and the environment."
Croatia,"An analysis of the effectiveness of the implemented measures for both the sector and the measures defined in the study to meet the obligations under Article 10 of Decision 529/2013/EU on reducing/maintaining emissions and increasing/maintaining greenhouse gas removal is needed to develop new guidelines and define measures in forestry and agriculture sector. When defining priorities, Regulation 841/2018/EU and Regulation 842/2018/EU should be taken into account. This measure includes the launch of professional and scientific research to improve the management of all LULUCF land categories in order to reduce emissions and increase removals."
Croatia,"Incorporates estimated mitigation potential of measures in the fugitive emissions sector in WAM scenario.
Description is given for each measure separately."
Croatia,"Regional energy agencies do not currently operate in the entire Republic of Croatia, and it is necessary to build the capacity of existing regional energy agencies in the field of climate change and their transformation into energy and climate agencies. The aim of this measure is to encourage the establishment and founding of regional energy agencies for the areas of the Republic of Croatia where they do not operate, and the transformation of existing energy agencies into energy and climate agencies."
Croatia,"Innovative information and communication technologies have an increasingly important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing energy efficiency. Intensifying their use in public administration, services and manufacturing processes, will boost productivity and work efficiency and at the same time will reduce energy consumption and consequent greenhouse gas emissions. The measure is expected to intensify the use of innovative ICT and monitoring of actual energy savings and reductions of greenhouse gas emissions."
Croatia,"ETS (Emissions Trading System) sector includes all activities listed in Annex I of the Regulation on trading with greenhouse gas emission allowances (OG 89/20) and for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from these activities plant operators involved in the trading system are responsible. Through the equal distribution of emission allowances, reduction commitments have been distributed to system participants from all Member States with the aim of contributing to emission reductions at EU level by at least 43% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.
From 1 January 2013, the Republic of Croatia is fully integrated in the EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS). Operators in Croatia - the pursuant in the EU ETS have obtained Permits for greenhouse gas emissions and have established a regime for emissions monitoring and reporting to the competent authority. Greenhouse gases covered by EU ETS are: carbon dioxide (CO2) for all activities and additionally for certain activities nitrous oxide (N2O). 
For aircraft operators in the Republic of Croatia, emissions monitoring and reporting of CO2 emissions started formally on July 1, 2013. However, due to certain specificities related to the responsibility for administering aviation flights prior to Croatia's accession to the European Union, aircraft operators were required to submit annual emissions reports from the aircraft starting from 2010."
Croatia,"The Regulation on unit charges, corrective coefficients and detailed criteria and benchmarks for determining the charge for emissions of carbon dioxide into the environment (OG 73/07, 48/09, 2/18, 46/21) stipulates the obligation to pay the CO2 emission tax for all stationary sources emitting more than 450 tons of CO2 per year. The obligated parties investing in energy efficiency, renewable energy and other measures to reduce CO2 emissions and other GHG emissions pay a lower tax. The Environmental Protection and Energy Efficiency Fund is authorized to calculate and charge the tax. From 2013 onwards, the obligation to pay the CO2 emission tax has applied only to non-ETS sources."
Croatia,"The signatories of the Covenant support a joint vision for 2050: accelerating decarbonisation of their territories, strengthening capacity to adapt to the inevitable impact of climate change and allowing citizens to access safe, sustainable and affordable energy. The signatory cities are committed to action that will support the reduction in greenhouse gases by 40% by 2030 and the adoption of a common approach to mitigating and adapting to climate change. In order to transfer their political engagement from theory to practical measures and projects, the signatories of the Agreement undertake to submit the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP). This initiative was accepted by 118 cities and municipalities in the Republic of Croatia, so that the Covenant of Mayors covers over 2.3 million inhabitants in the Republic of Croatia."
Croatia,"Charter on cooperation for the decarbonisation of buildings by 2050 is initiated by the Ministry of Physical Planning, Construction and State Assets, which supports the EU vision of decarbonisation of buildings by 2050. The charter was launched for better interdepartmental communication and cooperation between government and the real sector. The goal is to create a wide network of connected experts through workshops and open dialogue of partners who are ready for a joint dialogue and contribution to the decarbonisation of the building fund by 2050.  The contents of the Charter relate to the achievement of energy and climate goals at national and EU level through the decarbonisation of the building stock, renovation of buildings and construction of nearly-zero energy buildings, aware of the importance of further reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the share of renewable energy sources, improving energy security, and introducing innovations and smart technologies that enable buildings to support the overall decarbonisation of the economy. The signing of the charter encourages continuous cooperation in the development of the Long-Term Strategy for the Reconstruction of the National Building Fund and the transition to the standard of construction of near-zero energy buildings (nZEB). The signatories of the Charter provide support and promote the decarbonisation of buildings in their further activities, wherever possible."
Croatia,"The carbon capture and storage technology for large emission sources is not yet commercially available. According to Directive 2009/31/EC on geological storage of carbon dioxide, i.e. Article 36 of Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions, for power plants with a capacity of more than 300 MW that have received a building permit after the entry into force of Directive 2009/31/EC on geological storage of carbon dioxide, it is necessary to assess whether the following conditions are met: a) availability of a suitable storage location, b) technical and economic feasibility of transport facilities and c) technical and economic feasibility of upgrading the CO2 capture and collection facility. If these conditions are met, the competent authority must provide adequate space at the installation site for equipment to capture and compress the extracted CO2. Legislatively, this is covered by the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Exploitation Act (OG 52/18, 52/19), which enables the storage of CO2 in the territory of the Republic of Croatia. In accordance with the above, it is planned to prepare a study of storage capacity assessment, but also to prepare a National Feasibility Study with an action plan for preparatory activities for CCUS projects. This study will cover the phases of capture at emission sources, transport, injection and storage of CO2, and the connection of CO2 transport systems with other EU countries."
Croatia,"The Program for the Development of Green Infrastructure in Urban Areas for the Period from 2021 to 2030 (OG 147/2021) and the Program for the Development of Circular Management of Space and Buildings for the Period from 2021 to 2030 (OG 143/2021) were adopted, which achieve ecological, economic and social benefits of sustainable development. The programme for the development of green infrastructure in urban areas elaborates goals and measures for the development of green infrastructure which, among other things, increase the energy efficiency of buildings, reduce CO2 emissions and reduce temperatures in the areas of thermal islands in urban areas. The programme for the development of circular management of space and buildings elaborates goals and measures for circular management of space and buildings, which encourage, among other things, circular measures in planning new buildings, reusing abandoned and/or neglected and extending the durability of existing spaces and buildings, reducing construction waste and increasing the energy efficiency of buildings. The aim of this measure is to encourage cities and municipalities to base revitalization and development projects on new urban areas on the principles of sustainability."
Croatia,"The aim of the measure is to establish a Programme for calculation and reduction of carbon footprint of business entities outside the ETS system, in order to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions for all activities for which the business entity is responsible or on which it is dependent. It is necessary to calculate direct emissions and removals of greenhouse gases at the location of the business entity, either due to fuel combustion in the thermal power plant, from the production process and/or from the company's vehicles, indirect emissions that occur outside from the location of the business entity, and are related to the supply and consumption of electricity, heat and cooling energy, but also other indirect emissions/removals related to the flows of people, materials, waste and final products. The calculation of the carbon footprint will enable business entities to get acquainted with the structure of greenhouse gas emissions, i.e. to identify activities that most significantly contribute to reducing emissions, which is a good basis for the development and implementation of the Action Plan for carbon footprint reduction. The implementation of the Action Plan would lead to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the mitigation of climate change, i.e. easier realization of the obligations assumed by the Paris Agreement."
Croatia,"It is necessary to develop a systematic approach in all value chains related to the Croatian economy related to the measures listed in the Action Plan for the Circular Economy, based on which the EC integrates the principles of the circular economy in plastic production and consumption, water management, food systems and special waste management streams. The Circular Economy Committee was established, whose goal is to speed up Croatia's transition to a circular economy and achieve EU goals related to the reduction of waste generation, as well as the reduction of pressure on the environment, and the transformation of waste into high-quality secondary raw materials, incorporated into new products. The preparation of a national action plan for the transition to a circular economy through the adjustment of the legislative framework is underway. The creation of a national digital platform for the circular economy is also planned, which would also include a user portal for monitoring progress in achieving the goals of the circular economy from European and national legislation."
Croatia,"In the context of bioeconomy development, it is necessary to connect three key aspects: development of new technologies and processes; market development and competitiveness of sectors based on the principles of the circular economy and the political will for cooperation between policy and stakeholders. This should ensure the transformation of existing ""traditional"" stakeholders of the bioeconomy (farmers, family farms, food processing, forestry, wood processing, pharmaceutical, chemical industryÖ) into new, modern stakeholders in low-carbon economy and sustainable development while supporting the positive impact on ecosystems, climate and carbon cycle. An in-depth analysis of stakeholders (sectors) is necessary for the transition to a bioeconomy, and that their economic activity contributes to the achievement of development goals based on low levels of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. In parallel, the adjustment of the involved economic entities is needed for the use of funds from the announced EU funds intended for the transition to the bioeconomy."
Croatia,"The role of hydrogen in the energy and transport systems of the future is expected to be more significant, even more so as the targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be more ambitious. Therefore, it is necessary to identify opportunities related to the use of hydrogen in a timely manner, consider its application in the next decade and explore the possibilities of financially stimulating the production and consumption of hydrogen. To this end, a hydrogen technology platform will be established to connect national stakeholders relevant to hydrogen technology research and application, monitor the development of hydrogen technologies at EU and international level, and serve as a link between national, EU and international levels."
Croatia,"The system of energy efficiency obligations was established by the Energy Efficiency Act (OG 127/14, 116/18, 25/20), and its functioning is determined in more detail by the Ordinance on the System of Energy Efficiency Obligations (OG 41/19). The obligators of the system of energy efficiency obligations are energy suppliers. The goal is to achieve a reduction in energy consumption by end consumers."
Croatia,"The national system for monitoring, measurement and verification of savings (SMIV) is established on the basis of the Energy Efficiency Act (OG 127/14, 116/18, 25/20, 41/21) and the Ordinance on the System for Monitoring, Measuring and Verifying Energy Savings (OG 98/21, 30/22). This system is extremely important because it monitors energy savings and the resulting reduction in greenhouse gases and the system data are used for reporting. In the next period, it is necessary to maintain and improve the functionality of the system, connect it to other systems (EMIS), and inform and educate obligated parties about the correct data entry required to calculate and verify energy savings."
Croatia,"A National Commission for Green Public Procurement has been established to monitor the implementation of green public procurement through a survey questionnaire and an electronic public procurement notice. This measure represents a continuation of the initiated measures and further greening of public procurement procedures. Green public procurement will favour innovative low-carbon products and services, further encouraging their market entry, and the public sector will serve as a good example."

This PaM is part of the comprehensive car tax reform that has several goals, including the electrification of the company car fleet, electrification of the global car fleet (including private ones) by providing tax incentives for the purchase and installation of charging points and the reduction in traffic and the number of company cars through the mobility budget. In total, this reform of car taxation will consist of 4 sub-projects. This (sub)project specifically aims to make the company car fleet greener by 2026. To make this possible, by 2026 only zero-emission company cars will be able to benefit from the existing (para)fiscal benefit regime. However, a transitional arrangement/extinguishing scenario will be provided for those company cars with CO2 emissions."
Belgium,"Benefit in kind for company car linked to CO2 emissions instead of home-work distance.
The calculation formula has been completely revised and applies to all benefits granted since January, 2012 (income 2012, tax year 2013). The number of kilometers traveled has become irrelevant. The only parameters that matter now are: 
- The catalog value of the vehicle (and the VAT actually paid) 
- CO2 emission rate"
Belgium,"This PAM groups the actions that should lead to an improvement of the quality and the offer of rail transport for passengers. The aim is to increase the modal shift from road to rail for passenger transport. This would reduce GHG emissions and energy dependence on fossil fuels and lead to fewer cars on the road.
In order to improve the quality and offer of rail passenger transport in Belgium, the following 4 actions will be implemented before 2030:
Action 1: Investment in rail infrastructure 
Action 2: Measures to improve intermodality, multimodality and the quality of passenger reception
Action 3: Participate in the co-creation of a vision for the railway by the year 2040.
Action 4: Making the train more financially attractive"
Belgium,"The general objective of this PAM is to ""green"" the public authorities' fleet of vehicles by setting up a mechanism based on the one hand on the regulatory provisions (mobility package - Royal Decree ""agents"" - repeal of circular 307 sexies of 21 April 2017) as well as ""procurement tools"" necessary to concretize the implementation of greening rules. Vehicles acquired by the Federal State should meet ""zero emissions"" criteria and will take into account technological developments in the clean vehicle market."
Belgium,"Rail transport is characterized by low energy consumption (reduced track friction) and therefore by very low specific GHG emissions compared to other modes of transport. That is why the Belgian authorities will strive for a modal shift from road to rail for both passenger and freight transport in the coming years. At the same time, initiatives will be taken to make rail transport even more sustainable. These measures will aim, among other things, to reduce energy consumption, to use alternative fuels, to reduce noise emissions and to limit the impact on the fauna and flora along the tracks.
This PaM groups together the actions that should lead to an improvement in the quality of rail freight transport. The aim is to stimulate the modal shift from road to rail for freight transport and to double rail freight transport by 2030. This would reduce GHG emissions and energy dependence on fossil fuels and lead to fewer cars on the road ."
Belgium,Reform (Para)fiscal framework to promote sustainable mobility and intermodality.
Belgium,"The measure consists of the development of a Bicycle Action Plan (Be Cyclist),by Vias and FPS Mobility and Transport. The aim of the plan is to promote a modal shift to cycling. The plan will focus on concrete measures for a) more cyclists and b) positive communication about cycling."
Belgium,"Standardisation of tyres and fuels. Standardisation of tyres: implementing the EU regulation 2020/740 on tyres labeling to promote energy efficient tyres. Standardization of fuels: Renewable transport fuels are standardized by Royal order of 17 December 2021 to promote the production, trade and use of sustainable en less GHG intensive renewable transport fuels."
Belgium,In a Royal Decree (November 2008) teleworking is allowed for Federal civil servants. A number of federal public services have introduced teleworking for their employees. Allowances are provided to partially compensate for the costs generated by teleworking.
Belgium,In order to contribute to the objectives of e-mobility- the Federal Building Agency will study the possibility of including in its contracts buildings equipped for electromobility (wiring of charging stations in the 'private' car parks of buildings ...)- as well as in the stations of the SNCB.
Belgium,Action plan will be set up to phase out fossil fuel subsidies- taking into account- inter alia- ensuring the country's security of supply. This plan must include concrete steps as well as social corrective measures to accompany the transition to a climate-neutral society.
Belgium,"In order to reduce the traction energy consumption of rail transport and the associated CO2 emissions, the following 3 actions will be implemented in the period 2021-2030:
Action 1: Carrying out a cost-benefit study of the complete electrification of the Belgian railway network or other alternative solutions to replace diesel traction (FPS Mobility and Transport).
Action 2: Carrying out a study to determine how to reduce the costs of electricity for rail transport in Belgium ( FPS Mobility and Transport). The current and increasing integration of energy transition costs in the electricity costs for rail transport will be reviewed so that the modal shift to electric and more sustainable rail transport is not compromised.
Action 3: Reducing traction energy consumption of SNCB between 2021 and 2030 (Responsible: NMBS/SNCB)
By making better use of the potential of energy-efficient driving (eco-driving), by reducing the energy consumption of stationary trains through an eco-mode (eco-stabling), and by using more energy-efficient rolling stock, the specific energy consumption, expressed in Wh/t-km, can be reduced. This measure will gradually take effect over the period 2021-2030."
Belgium,"For decades, companies have been enjoying a tax advantage when they invest in energy savings, at a percentage tax deduction level that has varied in time. Information from FPS Finance revealed that the annual amount of investments benefiting from this tax deduction ranged between 40 to 180 million Ä. For 2004, the tax deduction was 13.5% for energy saving investments by companies (instead of 3.5% for standard investments). For the year 2009 the deduction level was raised to 15.5% for energy saving investments, while standard investments no longer benefited from a tax deduction, before being lowered again to 13.5% for the years 2010 and 2011. From 2011 the deduction level for energy saving investments has undergone several changes. It reached a rate of 15.5% in 2012 and 14.5% in 2013. since 2014, the rate is back to 13.5% and has not changed up to now.
A reform of the investment allowance is underway to make it more sustainable. Lists are currently being drawn up (energy, climate, mobility, digital) and the aim would be to review them regularly."
Belgium,"Updating and implementation of the federal circular economy roadmap in the form of a federal circular economy action plan. This Action plan aims to reduce resource consumption, combating climate change and the loss of biodiversity, to stimulate employment and reduce our dependence on foreign-produced resources. The plan contains 32 actions."
Belgium,"The use of fluorinated gases (F-gases) is widespread in industrial, commercial and domestic applications. F-gases are a group of greenhouse gases from which many have a very high global warming effect. To control emissions of F-gases, the EU adopted in 2006 the F-gas Regulation (842/2006), intended to control the production and the consumption of F-gases and incentivize the use of alternatives with less impact on climate change. In 2014, the original F-gases Regulation was replaced by Regulation 517/2014, which strengthen the existent measures and introduced new provisions on F-gases consumption and production, applicable from 2015. The main provisions of the new F-gases Regulation are the following:
- Limitation of the total amount of gases that can be sold in the EU, with the target of reaching an amount of one-fifth of 2014 sales.
- Banning the use of F-gases in certain application where less harmful alternatives are available in the market.
- Preventing the emissions from existent equipment by enhanced maintenance, quality control checks and recovery of gases.
The F-gases regulation impacts on the future evolution of GHG emissions in the following IPCC categories:
- Commercial refrigeration and Industrial refrigeration
- Stationary air conditionning
- Transport refrigeration
- Foam blowing agents ñ closed cells Fire protection
- Technical aerosols"
Belgium,The federal government will continue to use the so-called Green OLOs instrument to finance energy efficiency- public transport and renewable energy- the circular economy and biodiversity. Green Bonds are considered an innovative financial instrument showing Belgium's true climate ambitions as it is used to finance the greening of the economy and the environmental transition.
Belgium,"In March 2007, the Federal government decided an objective of 1 km2 of photovoltaic panels on roofs of the public buildings. This is to be achieved by three measures:
1.	Roofs will be made available for installing PV panels;
2.	Installation of PV panels by government. via FEDESCO/Buildinsagency;
3.	the three companies of NMBS/SNCB group and Infrabel have committed themselves to consider building and installing renewable energy equipment (e.g. solar or wind) via partnerships;
4.	The defence sector has also started to install PV panels"
Belgium,"The federal government leads by example by integrating sustainability criteria in public procurement (carbon clauses)- good example function through procurement. 
The general objective is that, via their sustainable public markets, the federal public authorities will give the necessary impetus to the market to engage in a decarbonized transition of the economy (greening of their vehicle fleets, purchase of green electricity, purchases in accordance with the principles of the circular economy, choice of award criteria, etc.).
This general objective will in particular involve research, within the framework of centralized federal public contracts, according to the purchasing segments: technical characteristics (labels, standards), relevant selection and award criteria or even integrating of the circular economy in public procurement or even to reserve contracts, in particular for adapted work companies. The prerequisite for this impetus will be an analysis of several relevant products and purchasing segments on which the emphasis can be placed."
Belgium,"Electrification is not possible for all applications: some require fuel to reach high temperatures, need hydrogen (or a derived molecule) as a feedstock for their molecule) as a raw material for their chemical reactions, or have weight and/or volume constraints that make a fuel particularly useful.
To take full advantage of the potential of renewable molecules in the energy transition, the market and value chain must rapidly develop. The federal government must play a role in to facilitate this development both through the establishment of a clear strategy supported by the sector, an effective regulatory framework and adequate financial support.
The technologies offer an additional opportunity to develop a strong economic sector in a sector that is essential for the future. This will support the transition of our economy towards sustainable and environmentally friendly activities, and create jobs in a meaningful sector.
Thanks to its central position in Western Europe, Belgium already plays a role as an energy hub for natural gas and petroleum products. To maintain this role and expertise, it is necessary to the development of the hydrogen sector in Belgium. This will ensure that expertise is maintained, that infrastructure is amortised more quickly and that hydrogen is available for use in the future. of the infrastructure and the availability of cheap renewable molecules for the benefit of Belgian consumers."
Belgium,Financial incentives for the rational use of energy (RUE) and renewable energy systems (RES) :  federal tax deduction for investments generating energy savings.  The Federal tax deduction was discontinued in January 2012- except for roof insulation (albeit at a lower rate). This last tax deduction mechanism was  transferred to the Regions in January 2015. (ref: EC-B01)
Belgium,Specific rational use of energy (RUE) aid for unprivileged people- who do not pay tax and thus may not benefit from tax exemptions. The Fund for the Reduction of the Global cost of Energy (FRGE) was used to improve the energy efficiency of housings for disadvantaged people via cheap loans (Vito-Econotec- 2015). The FRGE is transferred to the regions on 1 January 2015 Since tax exemptions for RUE investments were suppressed- such mechanisms are no more in application. (ref: EC-B03 )
Belgium,Specific aids to develop effluent management tools
Belgium,"The federal and regional PAMs to promote modal shift encompass a series of measures like free train service for commuters, extension of the tax deduction for expenses incurred for home-work travel when using alternative transport, ... To achieve free public transport by train to and from work for all employees, the Federal government has decided in 2008 to prolong the 80/20 system for private sector employees. It is still applied currently. In this system, 80% of the season ticket of the NMBS/SNCB is paid by the employer and 20% is paid by Federal government. The system of free commuting by train for employees of the Federal government has been permanently extended by a Royal Decree of 3 May 2007."
Belgium,Extra-legal advantage that the employer can provide to workers- intended to finance the acquisition of ecological goods and services. These cheques are exempt from taxes and social contributions.

It is part of the economic law of 27 March 2009. It is a temporary measure- only applicable to loans awarded between 1st January 2009 and 31st December 2011.
Belgium,"The federal government has fixed as objective that by 2007 all public services should be EMAS certified. EMAS certified entities set themselves objectives on the reduction of their energy consumption and an increasing use of bicycle and public transport for their employees. Besides, the management contracts of the SNCB group of companies foresee the establishment and implementation of an environmental policy plan."

Belgium,Both optimizing feed rations and feed efficiency as well as improving farm management can reduce methane emissions per animal. Further research into and the rollout of these measures are part of the covenant ìEnteric emissions of cattleî. The partners of the covenant committed themselves to achieve the target for enteric emissions by 2030. The coupled income support in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) will be phased out by 2027 at the latest and will be replaced by a sustainable alternative to both compensate for lost income support and to achieve the climate objectives for which the farmers concerned are making efforts.
Belgium,Similar to the industry sector- an energy policy agreement will be drawn up with the energy-intensive horticulture sector that will start in 2023. In addition- with the less energy-intensive farms- mini energy policy agreements will be drawn up- comparable to industrial SMEs.
Belgium,Measures within Manure Action Plan 6 (MAP6) and future MAPs to reduce soil emissions: adaptation of animal feed- adaptation of fertilization practices and crops- including evaluation of the system of nutrient emission allowances.
Belgium,"The implementation of the new Common Agricultural Policy (2021ñ2027) in Flanders will be used to support energy and climate objectives as much as possible. The aim is to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions within the agricultural sector, which will affect all types of greenhouse gas emissions in the agricultural sector, namely CO2, CH4 and N20."
Belgium,The energy policy agreements with the energy-intensive industry currently running from January 1- 2015 to the end of 2022- remain also after 2022 an important instrument for the realization of the Flemish objectives in the field of energy efficiency but also greenhouse gas emissions. Energy policy agreements will be used as a central policy instrument to support the industrial transition. - It will be investigated how the energy policy agreements will be continued from 2023. This research includes evaluating the current target groups- the profitability of the measures and the attractiveness for companies to participate. Consultations will be held with the sectors concerned to strengthen and broaden the EBO instrument. Part of the industry currently does not yet have the opportunity to participate.
Belgium,Various paths will be used to achieve a further greening of the energy carriers in the non-ETS industry by 10% by 2030. - In the first place- the focus is on sustainable direct generation of heat. Secondly- the greening of natural gas by producers indirectly leads to a lower emission intensity of the industry. Thirdly- more extensive electrification of the industry can lead to emission reductions. - An economic potential study must show to what extent these technologies can be used within a competitive framework for industry- with a view to the implementation of concrete business cases and the needs in terms of innovation- financing and infrastructure.
Belgium,The approach for this measure is - in two phases - via the special conditions imposed in the environmental permit. A first phase includes the installation of an end-of-pipe technique and a second phase includes a feasibility study to investigate additional measures.
Belgium,In order to respond to the challenges created by EU regulation 517-2014 on fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases)- the Flemish Action Plan for Reduction of F-gases from 2015-2020 was launched. Given that the technical potential is largely available- in addition to continuing the actions from the existing action plan- additional measures will be taken to further limit this F gas emissions.
Belgium,The separate collection and recycling of waste streams from households and companies is being pushed up to reduce CO2 emissions from incineration and primary plastic production. This is coupled with more cooperation with the federal government to make recyclable or reusable packaging more interesting through product policy or financial incentives.
Belgium,The realization of an effective reduction of the waste supply must lead to capacity being systematically reduced- starting with the least efficient capacity or with the highest emissions. An investigation will be started in collaboration with the sector into which instruments can be used to ensure that we actually reduce the least efficient capacity. The combustion capacity that we maintain in the meantime must have the highest possible energy efficiency and lowest possible emissions.

Belgium,Just as for forests and long-lying grasslands- it is more interesting in terms of carbon storage to retain existing wet areas than to replace them with waterlogging elsewhere. Various policy instruments will ensure carbon storage through waterlogging.
Belgium,Investments will be made in a net increase in high-quality nature. Both the realization of the nature conservation objectives in the context of the Natura 2000 policy and the realization of nature types with a large carbon storage potential are central. Coordination with integrated water management and climate adaptation is also a central principle here. By 2024- 20-000 additional hectares of nature will be brought under effective management.
Belgium,"The agricultural sector can reduce carbon losses through the following policies and related measures: 
- Preserve carbon stocks
- Promote carbon storage
- Valorizing carbon storage"
Belgium,For wind energy- the objectives of the 'Windkracht 2020' wind plan are taken into account corresponding to an installed capacity of 1-4 GWe by 2020. With a total an additional annual capacity of 108 MW-year- the total installed capacity will then be 2-5 GWe by 2030. To increase wind energy production- a Wind Plan 2025with a view to 2030 will be worked out.
Belgium,In the period 2021-2025 a further annual growth of 300 MWe is estimated and from 2025 a growth of 318 MW- so that in 2030 a capacity of 6.7 GWe solar PV will be achieved in Flanders. This objective is well within the possibilities of the potential determined by the Solar Map and within the possibilities for network integration and balancing. To increase solar energy production- a  Solar Plan 2025will be worked out with a view to 2030.
Belgium,The Coalition Agreement 2019-2024 provides for an increase in the minimum share of renewable energy in new construction. In this context- we are also investigating whether it is appropriate to split the minimum share of renewable energy in new construction into a minimum share of green energy and a minimum share of green heat.
Belgium,The increased use of the potential for green and residual heat for the various heat technologies is opted for. There will be a stronger focus on heat networks that facilitate the use of renewable heat or residual heat. This has also been the focus in recent years through the regular calls for green heat (incl. heating networks)- residual heat (networks)- injection of biomethane and geothermal energy.

Brussels-Capital Region has approved the 8th December 2016 the Government's Decree regarding energy audit of big establishments and energy audit related to the environment permit. This decree establishes the obligation of an energy audit for the biggest industrial establishments in the process area.
Belgium,Brussels: NRClick is a program accompanying public entities in their energy management. This program relies on 3 complementary services: an energy accounting tool- a central purchasing service and a support in the organization and the monitoring of projects to improve the energy efficiency of public buildings. The Brussels NECP extends this program after 2020.
Belgium,A green loan is in forced in Brussels with an interest rate between 0 and 2% for both individuals and enterprises. A loan can be obtained to finance energy efficiency or renewable energy projects.
Belgium,Between 2007 and 2013- the Brussels-Capital region organised an annual contest for the design and construction or renovation of buildings meeting strong environmental criteria- including energy use. Known as -- winning applications receive EUR 100-m2 of built area (EUR 90 for the contracting authority and EUR 10 for the design team)- to a maximum of EUR 1 million. They also benefit from technical support provided by the region to meet their stringent energy and environmental targets. In 2007 and 2008- 76 projects won the competition- totalling over 200 000 m2 of built area. The buildings consume up to 10 times less energy than conventional ones- and are built with ecological materials.
Belgium,Via Citydev.brussels- developping 1000 passive housing every five years
Belgium,Since 2018- a new free tool - the Solar Map - allows Brussels buildings owners to estimate the costs and the profits of a photovoltaic installation on their rooftops. For each address- the tool estimates the solar photovoltaic and thermal potential of the roof.
Belgium,EcoBuild is a cluster (group of companies- training centres- reaserch units- public administrations involved in energy technologies) committed to a partnership-based approach intended to generate synergies in relation to common projects of an innovative nature. Several projects aim to promote eco-construction such as Brussels greenbizz is a particular European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) project (2007-2013- Ä 16 million) aiming to set up an environmental business incubator in the areas of eco-construction- renewable energy and green products.
Belgium,"The SolarClick program aims at installing PV on rooftops of public buildings (administration- schools- sport infrastructures- etc.). PV panels are financed by the Brussels-Capital Region and the program is operationalized by the DSO- Sibelga. The Brussels NECP extends this program beyond 2021 in a synergy with the NRClick program (energy efficiency). However, due to the covid crisis, the initial program has to be extended in 2021 and the new format (in synergy with NRClick will be done in 2022)."
Belgium,Due to the limited RES potential of RBC- the Region will develop a strategy to install RES production units outside its territory.
Belgium,Adapt the mechanism of green certificates to support the installation of PV in the public space outside buildings and in large parkings
Belgium,Principle of a system of green certificates : 1. A green certificate is allocated to a producer of green electricity (including combined heat and power) every time its production avoids the emission of 217 kg of CO2- if it had to be produced in a reference fossil fuel plant (natural gas : combined cycle gas turbine) 2. Each year- a predefined (and annually increasing) percentage of electricity supplied to end users has to be covered by green electricity. Suppliers must restitute the necessary number of green certificates to demonstrate that they respect that rule. In case of failure- a penalty fee is due. This situation creates a market for green certificates for the benefit of green electricity producers.  Shares are regularly updated by regional regulation authorities. 3. The final cost of this system is borne by the final consumer through a tariff overload. - The Brussels NECP plans to evaluate the green certicates system in line with the evolution of renewable energy systems cost.  A better support for BIPV into the Green Certificate Mechanism is under development
Belgium,Manage and quality control of biomass available for material recuperation or for energy usage. The policy corresponds to the transposition of the  Directive 2009-28-EC concerning the sustainability criteria for bioliquids and biofuels.  Brussels Capital Region transposed the directive in the  - and applies only for bioliquids. Biofuels are the responsibility of the Federal entity. The transposition of the Directive (EU) 2018/2001 regarding the sustainability and emissions criteria for bioliquids and biofuels is under development.
Belgium,Recover all or part of the local collection of bio waste and green waste in a biogas plant. Only Brussels waste would be treated in this installation.
Belgium,The Governement will study the modification of the regional operating rules of the electricity market in order to favor the emergence of collective projects and a better valuation of local renewable electricity productions within a district while using and remunerating equitably the distribution network. To this end- the Government allows pilot projects- in priority with the aim of identifying the most favorable conditions and the simplest means for the development of collective self-consumption. On the basis of lessons learned from pilot projects- the Government will support energy community development projects (voluntary grouping of residents located downstream from a neighborhood terminal for collective management of energy consumption and production). Support will also be granted to cooperatives (existing or new) for the deployment of energy production facilities- whose a share will be accessible to anyone wishing to participate in a collective project.
Belgium,Gradually develop photovoltaic installations on the buildings of the Citydev.brussels Economic Expansion sites

Belgium,For companies having more than 10 company cars- there is an obligation to provide to employees a - (at least a self-service bicycle abonment- tickets for public transport or a bicycle - which should be electric from 2020).
Belgium,The Good Move strategy is an important mobility plan based on a diagnosis of the Brussels' mobility and aims a modal shift to public transport- walking and cycling
Belgium,The Region has many legal texts which introduce the following measures in the field of transport and mobility: each private or public body with more than 100 employees per site has to introduce transport planning-for events assembling over 6 000 participants an action plan to promote the use of public transport and of energy efficient and environmentally friendly means of transport must be instigated- regional public bodies and institutes with a car fleet of over 50 vehicles: within five years after the entry into force of the ordinance 20% of these vehicles have to use environmentally friendly technologies- The School Travel Plan (PDS) is a project  to promote sustainable management of travel in Brussels schools.
Belgium,Improve and promote public transport by: - continued development of public transport - setting quantified targets with the authorities and including them into their management conventions to increase the use of public transport. - improving infrastructures and services - creating new parking places for cars and bicycles close to train stations - reducing fares for certain categories of travelers - promoting the combined use of bicycle and public transport and therefore including the promotion of bicycles as an objective of public transport companies
Belgium,Creating or improving safe and comfortable infrastructures such as bicyclelanes- parking facilities-... And promotion of cycling through public transport
Belgium,Plan for freight transport which aims at: -reducing and optimizing the movements of vehicles carrying goods into and out of the city -a modal shift from the road to the waterway and rail and the remaining journeys (last mile) using more environmentally friendly vehicles
Belgium,Chapter 3 of the Brussels Code on Air Climate end Energy Control (COBRACE) regulates off-street parking. It provides that the parking standards applicable to new constructions are also applied to existing office buildings when their environmental permit is renewed. Considering that parking availability at destination is the most decisive factor in the decision to travel by car- this incentive has been implemented- expecting to reduce the ruch hour congestion by as much as 10%.
Belgium,The Brussels Region plans in its NECP to review the taxation of road transport in line with the objectives of the LEZ and in order to dissuade the purchase of vehicles poorly suited to the city. The Government also undertakes to cooperate with the other Regions for the implementation of a smart kilometer tax.

Belgium,Bruxelles Environnement carries out campaigns to promote RUE and RES
Belgium,The Brussels-Capital Region has developed the Local Action Plans for Energy Management (PLAGE). PLAGE projects develop a coherent and coordinated set of measures- which aims at identify the potential for energy savings and priorities for action. Organisations and enterprises with real estate bigger than 100.000m≤ are obliged to put in place a PLAGE project for their buildings. Federal and regional administrations with a real estate in Brussels bigger than 250m≤- and others public administrations with a real estate bigger than 50.000m≤ have to implement a PLAGE.
Belgium,Accreditation of energy experts based on specific criteria to guarantee their expertise
Belgium,Managing enterprises in coherence with their social and environmental neighbourhood. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is an improvement process in which businesses- on a voluntary basis- systematically and consistently include social- environmental and economic considerations in their business management- in consultation with their stakeholders (customers- staff- suppliers). - Brussels Environment is organising a large number of information and training sessions on environmental themes (energy- eco-construction- mobility- etc.). The seminars- colloquiums and guided visits are intended to inform professionals about the current legislation and the latest technological developments- to pass on technical advice from specialists and feedback from other bodies and to allow them to become familiar with exemplary installations. The training is organised in cycles which take place over several months and usually end with an evaluation leading to a certificate. The training is intended for a specialised public wishing to acquire specific knowledge in the technical field.
Belgium,The ´ Eco Dynamic ª Label is awarded to businesses that develop sustainable management measures and pursue a green policy and can demonstrate that they are making progress notably in areas such as waste management- the rational use of energy or workers mobility management. From an administrative point of view- this label is less cumbersome than the EMAS or ISO 14001 labels and is therefore more suited for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEís) or other small structures. Bodies applying for the label are offered tailored coaching by an expert. A simplified procedure has been put in place for EMAS and ISO 14001certified bodies applying for the Brussels label. With 338 sites having been awarded the ìEntreprise Ecodynamiqueî label- it has been proven a great success.

Belgium,Establish a long-term calendar for the adaptation of the regional incinerator- taking into account the progressive reduction of the flows intended for incineration- while maintaining the autonomy of the Brussels Region -Capital in the management of its own waste. The study that will frame this adaptation will be conducted in 2020 and will focus on reducing emissions- on upgrading residual waste streams by energy production- on waste imported into Brussels regions and on socio-economic and environmental effects of this transformation (energy production- indirect impacts linked to changes in collection- etc.). The Government will carry out a phasing out study of this incinerator- a phasing out that is desirable in order to meet the region's greenhouse gas emission obligations.
Belgium,"The Walloon long-term energy renovation strategy for buildings is a key link in the policies to reduce GHG emissions, to which Wallonia has committed itself by aiming for ""carbon neutrality by 2050 at the latest, with an intermediate step of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 55% compared to 1990 by 2030"".

The Walloon long-term energy renovation strategy for buildings aims to mobilise investments in the renovation of the public and private building stock, for residential and tertiary use, and is in line with the principles of the Walloon Government confirmed in particular in the Regional Policy Declaration. It aims to create a highly energy-efficient and decarbonised building stock by 2050, ensuring that occupants have healthy and comfortable spaces that serve the activities they carry out there.

The strategy was updated in order to answer to the 2018/844/EU Directive in 2020."
Belgium,"This vision will be part of a coherent global framework allowing it to be implemented concretely and efficiently:
A Walloon mobility code will gradually be drawn up to integrate the various decrees in the form of books: general provisions, organisation of the TEC Group, taxi services, complementary mobility solutions, municipal mobility plans, etc.
The vision is perfectly in line with the Territorial Development Plan (SDT)
The vision will be translated into concrete actions in the Regional Mobility Plan (SRM). It will be ensured that these actions are consistent with the territorial development (SDT), economic (Marshall Plan) and digital (Digital Wallonia) strategies."
Belgium,"Mobility and Fleet Facilitator offers individual coaching to companies and public authorities in order to guide them towards new mobility practices.

RENOLAB also aims to make sustainable renovation more attractive and to contribute to the emergence of new services and multiple and varied tools that fully support the renovation strategy.
Belgium,"In March 2018, the ëcash for carí system was put in place, to enable employees to exchange their company cars for a mobility allowance. In complement in March 2019, a 2nd alternative for the company car was introduced, the 'mobility budget'. The employee who wishes to trade in his car for cash or a mobility budget must have had a car for at least 12 months during the past 3 years, of which 3 months uninterruptedly before the application for the allowance. At the same time, the employer must have a system of company cars in place for at least 3 years. The mobility allowance and mobility budget only apply to employees.
The mobility budget is equal to the annual gross cost of the company car the employee is entitled to at the moment of the request. The employee can choose or combine from 3 different options: 1) use an environmentally friendly company car, emitting a maximum of 100 grams CO2 per km2, 2) a budget, free of tax, to spend on sustainable modes of transport (purchase and maintenance of (electric) bicycles, electric motorcycles, public transport, sharing solutions, housing costs), 3) the remainder of the mobility budget will be paid in cash to the employee at the end of the year, without income tax but with a social security tax of 38,07%.
As of the 1st of January 2021, the ëcash for carí system is no longer in place. The Constitutional Court, annulled the law of 30 March 2018 concerning the introduction of a mobility allowance."

Greece,"The start year for the policies aiming for the promotion of RES for electricity generation is 1994, when the OPE (Operational Programme Energy within the 2nd Community Support Framework, 1994-1999) and the provisions of the National Development Assistance Act providing investment cost subsidies in combination with Law 2244/94, which specifies favourable buy-back tariffs for electricity generated from renewable energies. Greece developed its policy framework under the European Union (EU) Renewable Energy Directive (Directive 2009/28/EC), which set out an overall binding national target for Greece of 18% of renewable energy sources in gross final energy consumption for 2020. Greece set the following indicative sector targets according to the national renewable energy action plan (NREAP, time frame 2010-2020) for the contribution of renewable energy source to:- gross final energy consumption for heating and cooling: at least 20%- gross final electricity consumption: at least 40%- gross final energy consumption in transportation: at least 10%."
Greece,"In 2005, Law L3054/2002 ìOrganization of the oil market and other provisionsî was amended to include biofuels in the existing legal framework for oil products. The new Law, L3423/2005 ìIntroduction of biofuels and other renewable fuels in the Greek marketî (O.G. Aí 304/13.12.2005) transposed Directive 2003/30/EC in the Greek legal system and provided for the introduction of biofuels into the oil market. In order to increase the use of biofuels according to Law 3340/2005 the excise tax for these biofuels was null for the years 2005, 2006 and 2007. Since December 2005 pure biodiesel is blended (according to EN 590:2004) by the 4 Greek oil refineries in diesel used in transport up to 5% by volume. By decision 460/2009 (O.G. Bí 67/28.01.2010) of the State Chemical Council (SCC) the EN 590:2009 standard was adopted formally and the maximum biodiesel percentage was increased to 7%. According to the provisions of Law 3054/2002, a specific quantity of pure biodiesel is allocated to beneficiaries to achieve the 7% mandatory percentage of biodiesel blended in diesel (per volume). Similarly, the obligation to blend petrol with bioethanol to 1% for the year 2019 and 3.3% in 2020 to 5% by volume of energy was introduced, while there is the possibility of increasing this percentage after 2020."

Greece,"Collection and flaring / energy use systems of landfill gas are being installed in all managed sites for urban centres with population more than 100,000. Already, the managed disposal sites serving the population of the largest cities of Greece are equipped with systems for the collection or for the flaring of biogas. In the Psyttalia wastewater treatment plant that serves approximately 4 millions of Attica population, a part the sludge produced is treated under anaerobic conditions resulting in the production of biogas. The biogas produced covers the energy needs of the wastewater treatment facilities."
Greece,"To control emissions from fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases), including hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), the European Union has adopted two legislative acts: the ëMAC Directiveí (2006/40/EC) on air conditioning systems used in small motor vehicles, and the ëF-gas Regulationí (No 517/2014) which covers all other key applications in which F-gases are used. The two strategies described in the abovementioned regulation to reduce emissions is to prevent leakage and emissions {Emission prevention and leak checks, Control of by-production, End of life treatment of products and equipment, Training and qualification, Information for users (labelling, product info)} and control of use of F-gases (Ban on new applications, Ban on uses, Phase-down of HFC supply). Several control mechanisms and penalties are implemented in Greece. Checks for compliance with these regulations of the European Union are carried out by the relevant bodies and agencies of the competent authorities, as appropriate, in the context of their remit. In cases of infringement of the provisions of the relevant EU Regulations by legal or natural entities of the public and private sector, sanctions are imposed by the relevant bodies and agencies of competent authorities.It is considered that the action taken by the EU and its Member States under the F-gas Regulation will enable the EU to comply with the Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol on a global phase-down of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)."
Greece,"The reduction of the rate of intensity of agricultural land use and the adoption of rules for the obligatory observance of cross compliance system relating to manure management contribute to the reduction of GHGs.Moreover, the disengagement of subsidies from the agricultural production has already enhanced indirectly the reduction of agricultural production and livestock population. In fact, the disengagement of subsidies from the agricultural production along with the enhanced urbanized way of life consist the main reasons for the reduction of agricultural production."

Finally, both the establishment of knowledge-intensive start-ups for the commercial exploitation of mature research results and innovative ideas will be strengthened, as well as the development of entrepreneurship support structures, such as incubators, technology parks, co-working spaces, etc.
During this period, significant support was provided in this field by the General Secretariat for Research and Innovation (GSRI) through its Multiannual Financial Plan for Research Infrastructures, as well as through the ""Collaborative formations to promote innovation in local entrepreneurship"" (Innovation Clusters) and the GSRIís transnational cooperation projects (ERANETs, Bilateral R&T cooperation programmes, etc.)."
Greece,"It aims at improving the existing regulatory framework for the implementation of investments in industrial plants and SMEs, in order to create a stable and transparent investment framework of rules, procedures and administrative structures for the smooth completion of large public and private projects. In addition, with the aim of higher leverage of private capital, the effectiveness of existing support schemes of private investments will be assessed in order to continue the implementation of the most efficient among them and/or to attempt to implement new ones."
Greece,"It concerns the strengthening of the role of Special Target Funds, in order to facilitate the provision of concessional financing to SMEs and for undertaking part of the business risk which is not undertaken by financing institutions, while providing the necessary guarantees."
Greece,"This measure aims at increasing the interconnection capacity between Greece and neighbouring countries. Interconnected counties can be coupled increasing price convergence and stability and enhancing market competition. In the last 4 years, no new power interconnections have commenced operations, however 5 new interconnections are in different stages of development, with the second Greece - Turkey and Greece - Bulgaria interconnection projects being the most mature. In addtion, the planned Greece-Cyprus-Israel line aims at the interconnection of countries where no connection existed previously."
Greece,"This measure refers to the evaluation of planned investments in the electricity transmission and distribution systems, before making a final invesment decision. It is crucial that a net benefit is estimated for each project after subtracting costs from the expected social benefit. Regarding, strategic projects for the digitalization and modernization of the electricity distribution system (incl. smart meters), a cost benefit analysis is also essential in establishing their net benefit, although methodology is independent of ENTSO-G guidelines."
Greece,"The measure foresees that the majority of the Non Interconnected Islands (NIIs) will be interconnected to the mainland by the year 2030 and therefore constitutes a strategic priority of IPTO aiming to terminate the electricity isolation of islands, to phase out the majority of heavy polluting ASPs (Autonomous Station Plants) burning fossil fuels (HFO, diesel), to reduce CO2 and other gas emissions, to reduce the generation cost, to develop RES penetration to electricity generation exploiting the abundant RES potential of the islands, to reduce the cost of SGIs (Services of General Interest) and to significantly improve reliability and security of supply.
So far, the interconnection of the Northeast Cyclades (three phases) was successfully completed in 2020 and Phase I of the Crete interconnection (AC link Peloponnese ñ Crete) was completed in 2021. Phase II of the Crete interconnection (DC link Attica ñ Crete) is currently under construction, with an expected commissioning date in 2024. 
The South West Cycladic islands interconnection is expected to be commissioned in 2025 (on-going project), while the interconnection of the Dodecanese islands and the of North East Aegean islands is planned and expected to be commissioned in 2027 and 2028 respectively."
Greece,"This meaures aims at the develpment of natural gas infrastructure projects connecting Greece with neighbouring countries, allowing diversification of natural gas sources. This leads to increased security of supply as well as a more competitive market lowering relevant costs and direct and indirect benefits for consumers. Other tham supporting new interconnections, the focus of this measure is also the enhancement of exisitng infrastructures through the scale up (increase) of current transmission capacitites."
Greece,"The Measure supports the completion of electricity or natural gas storage projects, which are under implementation or planning and contributes to the update the relevant regulatory framework"
Greece,"The measure aims at supporting the deveopment of natural gas and electricity distribution systems in new areas with close proximity to existing systems. The system's development should be supported by adequate increase in demand from households and industial users, with the aim to increase efficiency for these end uses and also substitutute heavily polluting fuels"
Greece,"Increasing penetration of renewables has brought  profound changes in the variability of the system. Consequently, assessing the capacity adequacy of a system has become more complex than before, making the traditional approach insufficient in ensuring reliability in a system with high amounts of variable RES.The modern approach to capacity adequacy is multi-dimensional and needs to assess specific issues around system flexibility. Flexibility assessment requires measuring flexibility of demand by the system and flexibility of supply by power generation resources, storage, interconnections and demand response. The capacity mechanism will include storage, demand response and gas-fired plants, which supports higher flexibility."
Greece,"The implementation of electricity market reforms such as the Target Model allows a more efficienct and transparent market, leading to increased competition and thus lower prices for consumers. The target model also enables the integration with the European energy market and thus their price convergence, benefiting consumers and businesses. In addition, certain mechanisms such as the feed-in tariffs provides certainty around the revenue of RES assets."
Greece,"This measure aims at a more efficient operation of the coupled markets, by allowing better use of transmission and generation assets, including RES whose energy production is hard to predict. Also, market coupling allows increased competition between power producers and traders, as they have access to a larger pool of clients. The more efficient  market operation lead to reduced costs for consumers and helps improve grid reliability through reduced congestion."
Greece,"The measure aims to promote measures to strengthen the participation of demand, and consumers in general, in the electricity market, thus enabling consumers to influence electricity prices. In order to achieve this specific goal, the completion of the regulatory framework for demand response is required."
Greece,"This measure concerns the preservation of the mechanism for the allocation of Natural Gas Quantities through Electronic Auctions (gas release), as it strengthens competition for the benefit of consumers."
Greece,"This measure refers to initiatives that improve market efficiency, transparency and liquidity, ultimately benefiting consumers. With the implementaion of the Gas Trading Platform a spot market for gas in Greece was established, allowing more trading opportunities and also supporting the balancing operations of DESFA. In addition, the privatization of natural gas distribution networks and liberization of the further market liberalization increase competitivess in the sector, which leading to improved service quality and lower costs/prices."
Greece,This measure refers to the maintainance and improve the social tariff scheme applies to protect vulnerable consumers from energy poverty. The eligible customers meet income and social criteria specified by the law. Such customers receive a discount specified by the regulation. The budget of this measure is set at Ä 40 mln per year and is estimated to aid around 100.000 households.
Greece,"Mechanisms applied by the Regulatory Authority protect consumers from significant price fluctuations. Other than obliging suppliers to publish tariff condition, tariff monitoring and supervision systems, collect information such as prices offered, margins, revenues and market shares. Consequently, potential price mark-up as well as the eeconomic viability of suppliers can be evaluated."
Greece,This measures is intented to protect consumers that are not representanted by an electricity supplier. This right is secured by  EU legislation which entitles every consumer to have their home connected to the electricity distribution network. Thus vulnurable consumers are automaticlly placed on the universal service.
Greece,This measure aims at increasing the energy efficiency of housholds so lower energy demand is required for vulvnurable households. In addition the installation of domestic RES applications allows decentralized energy generation and reduces tranmission system requirements.
Greece,"The measure aims to provide incentives both to energy providers within the framework of the Energy Performance Obligation Enforcement Regime, and to Energy Communities, in order to contribute more actively to the energy upgrading of the specific buildings."
Greece,"The measure's implementation aims to strengthen the necessary control mechanisms to ensure the transparent and lawful operation of the petroleum market and to safeguard consumer protection. In addition, the modernization of gas stations is planned, so that they can be modernized and supply consumers with all alternative fuels."
Greece,"The implementation of the lignite plan decommisioning creates the need to restructure the economic model of areas where the plants used to/ or currenlty operate. Actions include initiatives to restore the enviromental impact of the power plants operation and substitute services existing as a byproduct of the lignite power plant operation, such as district heating."
Greece,"The implementation of cross-border transmission projects will significantly enhance the countryís energy role in the wider region of South-Eastern Europe as 
an energy hub. Also, increased diversification of energy supply is accomplished between already interconnected counties, but also with new ones. In addition, the increased interconnection capacity reduces congestion in existing interconnections and helps system adequacy during peak load times, which is challenged by the unpredictability of RES produciton. In the design phase, there are many energy infrastructure projects of direct interest to Greece, such as The Greece - Republic of North Macedonia vertical interconnection. Planned or ongoing new interconnection projects are the 2nd interconnections between Bulgraria, Italy and Albania, and the new interconnections with Cyprus and Egypt."
Greece,"This Measure aims to promote measures to strengthen the participation of demand, and in general consumers, in the electricity market. The development of the demand response framework has been integrated into the long-term power adequacy mechanism under construction."
Greece,"The implementation of cross-border gas transmission projects will significantly enhance the countryís energy role in the wider region of South-Eastern Europe as an energy hub. Specifically, international interconnection projects that are in develpment

Support for this purspose is offered through development of the relevant regulatory framework and the establishment of applicable funding schemes.
Greece,"This measures supports the interconnection of the majority of Greek non-interconnected islands with the  mainland electrical system,  for the reduction of electricity generation from imported fuels and utilisation of local RES capacity in the most cost effective manner."
Greece,"This measure aims at reducing the dependence on imported fossil fuels, which represent a majority share of energy sources in transport. Domestically produced electricity from RES along with the wider uptake of electric vehicles will contribute in the substitution of fossil fuels and reducing relevant emissions in accordance with EU targets."
Greece,"This measure aims to substitute imported fuels with electricity sourced from RES in the heating and cooling sector through targeted actions, given that RES are a domestic source, with the exception of biofuels, to the extent that they do not come from EU countries."

Iceland,"Reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the fishing industry through various policies and measures. Systematic measures will be undertaken to achieve an energy change in the fishing industry. The Icelandic fishing sector has already achieved significant results in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in recent years, but there are still many opportunities for improvement. It is crucial to seize those opportunities in order for Iceland to reach its climate targets. Creating a defined framework in order for the sector to be able to do its part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is a joint venture between the government and the fishing sector. A working group with representatives from 5 ministries, lead by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs, has been appointed to work towards this goal. This working group finished a report in 2021 proposing a target of 50% decrease in emissions from fishing ships in 2030 compared to 2005. The measures proposed in that report to reach that target are still being reviewed by the responsible ministry, which currently is the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries."
Iceland,"It will be ensured that tax subsidies for sustainable vehicles, which have been in place since 2012, will continue and be increased for as long as it is deemed necessary. According to a law amendment on VAT which was approved in parliament in December 2019, concessions for electric- and hydrogen cars have been extended until the end of 2023. Maximum sums and amount limits have also been increased. In addition, an amendment was made for concessions for hybrid vehicles; their amount limit was increased but the maximum concession will be reduced in steps until the end of 2022. Simultaneously provisions were legislated that businesses are permitted to depreciate/write off purchases of sustainable vehicles fully in the purchasing year. VAT will furthermore be cancelled completely but for a limited number of public group vehicles (such as buses) which are only powered by methane, methanol, electricity or hydrogen. A temporary authorization to fully refund the VAT on home charging stations for electric vehicles, as well as the labour to install them, has been put in place. An exception from VAT will be given to car rentals for the rental of sustainable cars and there will be exceptions up to a certain limit for light and heavy electric- or hydrogen motor vehicles. Furthermore, an exception from VAT has been given for bikes and electric bikes up to a certain limit. The concessions are temporary and will be reviewed based on their results."
Iceland,"Encourage the further electrification of ports across the country. Ports across the country will be further electrified systematically. In 2020 grants for infrastructure projects regarding electrical connection and connection to district heating whilst ships are at harbour, in order to reduce reliance on fossil fuels while ships are at harbour. This will be useful for medium sized ships, large trawlers, ferries and service boats. Tourism companies will also have the opportunity to apply for grants as there are many possibilities for electrification in that sector. Whale watching boats and other smaller boats which sail shorter distances with tourists, to and from the same port, could for example possibly be electrified. Unlike the larger fishing ships, tourism boats which do many trips a day, would need access to fast charging stations, which are currently not very common. It has been proposed that projects regarding alterations to the ships and land based infrastructure will also have the possibility to apply for grants. The grants will be up to 33% of the start-up costs. The goal is that electrical connections are able to meet the electrical demand to run the general operations of ships while at harbour by 2025."
Iceland,"Finalize the electrification of fish-meal factories and ensure that there will not be a setback in the development which has already occurred. The energy change in fish meal factories will be finalized in collaboration with the operators. In the past years fish meal factories have been quite successfully electrified at the operators own initiative. It is important to complete this switch to electricity where it is technologically feasible. Emissions from fish meal factories are volatile in nature, but the overall trend over the last few years is downward. In 1997 emissions from fish meal factories were at their highest, at over 209 kt. They had, however, been reduced to 5  kt in 2019, but have increased somewhat again since then. It must be ensured that this development continues and does not suffer from any setbacks by working on quitting the burning of fossil fuels in fish meal factories completely. One of the measures that will be taken is establishing how electricity security can be increased in the places where fish meal factories are operating, how other technological hindrances can be overcome, and how it can be ensured that the price of electricity to fish meal factories is cost-effective compared to oil. The fish meal factory association and representatives from the various operators have already been contacted."
Iceland,"Reducing and ultimately stopping the use of fuel oil in the Icelandic coastal zone. The requirements on fuels used in the Icelandic coastal zone will become stricter to reduce the use of fuel oil. Fuel oil is a denominator for heavy oils with certain properties and can contain a high share of sulphur. Fuel oil is, among other fuels, used in shipping and when it burns a lot of soot and air pollutants are released into the atmosphere. The policy as been expanded since the first publication of the climate action plan and in December 2019 the Minister for the Environment and Natural resources signed a regulation on the sulphur content of particular liquid fuels. On the 1st of January 2020 , a requirement came into force in the Icelandic Coastal Zone, which is a similar requirement as the one in place in Emission Control Areas (ECAs) in the Baltic and North seas, where the restrictions on fuel oil are some of the strictest. After these regulation changes, the permitted sulphur content of marine fuel in Iceland is only 0.1% in the Icelandic coastal zone and internal waters. Previously, the sulphur content was permitted to be up to 3.5%. This effectively prohibits the burning of fuel oil unless ships use approved methods to limit emissions of sulphur dioxide. The Environment Agency has a monitoring role with this regulation and restrictions will be increased if it is deemed necessary."
Iceland,"Effective emissions reductions from geothermal power plants. Ways to further diminish greenhouse gas emissions from geothermal power plants will be looked into. Although fossil fuels are not used as an energy source in geothermal power plants, they still emit CO2. In 2021, geothermal power plants were the source of 6.4% of Icelandës ESD emissions. In the past years these emissions have decreased significantly due to measures by Orka n·tt˙runnar (ON) at the geothermal plant Hellisheiarvirkjun. Orkuveita ReykjavÌkur (ReykjavÌk Energy) developed the ÑCarbFixì or Ñgas in rockì method in collaboration with the University of Iceland and foreign collaborators (see measure 306: Carbon capture from heavy industry) and it has received interest all over the world. ON and Landsvirkjun have shown a great deal of initiative in their plans to reduce emissions from their power plants. As well as reducing emissions through re-injecting CO2 into the basaltic rock HS Orka has been exploring various other solutions and the possibilities to capture CO2 and use it for producing fuel or in other types of industrial production. The companies are working on this measure on their own initiative but the government will follow future developments and consult with them. The goal is for emissions from geothermal power plants to be reduced by at least 47% by 2030 compared with 2005. This measure is connected with measure 306 on carbon capture from heavy industry."
Iceland,"There are many opportunities for energy transition from fossil fuel to renewable fuel in different sectors of manufacturing industries, such as food production and industries linked to fisheries. In 2021 the Energy fund provided grants and many of the projects that were funded were for manufacturing industries."
Iceland,"Several projects have already been started and it will be ensured that the further development and improvement of infrastructure will continue. A project management team for energy change has been established to ensure the coordination between the projects and plans which relate to energy change. GrÊna orkan has developed a proposal for the prioritization of projects regarding infrastructure to support energy change. In November 2019 investment grants were allocated to the installation of quick charging stations. The new stations are thrice as powerful as the previous most powerful stations which were in place in the country and should support the unobstructed travel of electric vehicles across the country. Quick charging stations which have received grants from the government herewith increase by 40% around the country. Projects to increase the number of charging stations at hotels and other accommodations around the country have also begun and more such grants will be advertised in 2020. Furthermore, investment grants will be advertised in parallel for companies which run vehicle fleets, whether passenger cars or buses. In all instances it is expected that the grant applicants will provide a counter-contribution and OrkusjÛur will supervise the grants. The purposeful support of improved infrastructure will continue and other sources of energy than electricity will also be considered. GrÊna orkan and other stakeholders will be consulted as appropriate."
Iceland,"This policy will ensure that laws and regulations support energy change, whether they are occurring on land, at ports or at airports. The Minister for the Environment and Natural Resources has made two alterations to the regulations on new buildings; now it is mandatory to plan space for charging stations for electric vehicles at all new buildings in the country. A regulation for apartment buildings came into effect in June 2018 and a regulation for commercial buildings came into effect in December of the same year to ensure that charging stations for electric vehicles have been planned in all new builds in the future. The Ministry of Social Affairs has been working on simplifying the charging of electric vehicles at older apartment buildings. A bill on changing the laws on charging stations for electric vehicles at older apartment buildings was approved in Parliament in June 2020. At the Ministry of Industries and Innovation work on implementing the European Directive on infrastructure for energy change is underway. It contains the countriesë duties to develop policies on supporting the building of infrastructure for sustainable energy sources and fuels, including charging stations for electric vehicles and power stations for vehicles which use natural gas or hydrogen. A part of the Directive is setting technical requirements so that, for example charging stations fulfil coordinated standards. More work on implementing other Directives concerning energy change and climate change is underway at the Ministry. It will, furthermore, be monitored whether laws and regulations need to be altered or updated further to facilitate energy change in Iceland."
Iceland,"The new registration of passenger cars which are fueled by diesel or gas will be banned from 2030. The supply of clean energy vehicles and other more sustainable vehicles has increased rapidly in a short space of time. This policy is based on a principle and how it develops will depend on technological advancement. It is, therefore, expected that there will be some exceptions to the rule, for example due to regional perspectives or for the vehicles of first-responders. The policy also only affects new registrations of diesel- or gas fueled vehicles, it will still be permitted to drive, buy and sell used diesel- or gas fueled vehicles. The ban only applies to the import of new vehicles which are only fueled by fossil fuels. Hereby a significant step is taken in the direction of phasing out fossil fueled vehicles completely. Various other countries, including the UK, France and Norway, have set targets for banning the new registration of fossil fueled vehicles at a certain time. The signal this policy sends to car manufacturers is very important because plans to produce specific car types are made in the long term. It is, therefore, important that governments all around the world set targets for when markets for fossil fueled cars will either shrink significantly or close entirely. GrÊnvangur, a collaboration platform on climate issues and green solutions between businesses and government has launched the project Hreinn, 2 and 3, which focuses on increasing the number of clean energy vehicles at Icelandic companies, many of which operate a large fleet. It is expected that the new registration of fossil fueled passenger cars will be stopped by the year 2023."
Iceland,"The policy is focused on improving infrastructure to encourage more people to use active modes of transportation, such as biking and walking. Biking- and walking paths will be improved systematically to increase the share of active modes of transportation and enable more people to choose that option. Support for building paths will be increased, both in urban areas and to connect urban areas. In the capital area the transportation agreement between the government and six municipalities, which was signed in September 2019, will be followed. The agreement includes (among others)  a substantial effort to build new biking paths in the capital area (approximately 70-100 km of paths), as well as building new walking bridges and underpasses. Simultaneously work on bike paths between urban areas will be continued according to the Transport Plan (Samgˆngu·Êtlun) 2020-2034 and in cooperation with and with matched funds from the relevant municipalities. Possibilities to build bike lanes alongside highways will also be explored. .The options to set up charging stations for electric bikes will also be analysed in connection to an analysis on the possibilities for fuel change in the tourism sector."
Iceland,"The adoption of sustainable rental cars will be accelerated systematically in cooperation with car rental companies. Car rentals are responsible for the purchasing of 40% of new cars in Iceland, the highest share in the world. In 2018 approximately 60% of travellers rented a car during their visit to Iceland. According to an analysis by Õslensk N˝Orka, which was conducted during Iceland's presidency of the Nordic Council of Ministers (NorrÊna r·herranefndin) in 2019, most car rental companies have a strong interest in adopting clean energy cars in their operations. There are, however, various obstacles to this development. This measureës primary aim is to analyse the main obstacles and opportunities to accelerate energy change in the car fleets of car rental companies through a comprehensive needs- and costs analysis. The measure is connected to measure 201 on concessions for climate friendly vehicles, because with the changes which took effect at the beginning of 2020 to accelerate energy change in road transport, renting out sustainable cars became exempt from VAT turnover. The measure is also connected to measure 202 on infrastructure for climate friendly vehicles, as a special project to install charging stations at accommodations around the country has already begun."
Iceland,"Public transport will be promoted and supported in all Iceland. The government and six municipalities in the capital signed an agreement in September 2019 with an ambitious plan to build up transport infrastructure and public transportation in the capital area in the next 15 years. The agreement contains the most extensive transportation construction plan in the history of Iceland. The goal is to greatly boost public transport, improve transport for all modes of transportation, reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reach the government's and municipalities' climate goals, reduce traffic jams, etc. BorgarlÌnan is a part of the agreement and the preparations for construction are currently underway. BorgarlÌnan will be a new transportation system with separate priority lanes at traffic lights and frequent trips. In addition, the public transport will use domestic renewable fuels, such as electricity, hydrogen or methane. The construction of 42 km of BorgarlÌnan routes, reaching most of the capital area, has been agreed upon.  Public transport in rural areas will furthermore be organised holistically, including looking into supporting public transport in order for it to be a competitive option versus a single person driving a car."
Iceland,"Government/state enterprises will be obligated to purchase sustainable vehicles when renewing their vehicle fleet. All government/state owned cars will be sustainable as a rule, the only exceptions being if safety- or usage purposes require something else. State entities will, therefore, not purchase new fossil fueled cars as a main rule from 2020. The Icelandic government approved this policy in 2019. Central public procurement (RÌkiskaup) and a so-called car committee are responsible for implementing the new procurement procedures, and the organisations which intend to purchase vehicles are bound to participate in common tenders where the tender descriptions ensure that sustainable and economical cars will be purchased such as electric, hydrogen or methane fueled vehicles. The state runs approximately 800 vehicles of various shapes and sizes. This measure aims to transform the vehicle fleet to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as to pave the way for a ban on the new registration of gas- and diesel cars (see measure 204). The government approved in November 2018 that all ministerial cars would be electric, and this transition is already underway. Approximately half of the ministerial cars are now fully or partly electric and according to the current plans all ministerial cars will be fully electric before the end of 2022."
Iceland,"Achieve an energy change in ferries which are in regular operation and which are categorized as a part of the national highway system. Energy sources in ferries which are in regular operation will be switched out for more sustainable non-fossil fueled options where technological development allows it. There are five ferries currently in operation in Iceland, three of those are state owned. 1. HerjÛlfur , the Westman Island ferry. The new HerjÛlfur is a hybrid and it is expected that the ship will sail completely on electricity from the Icelandic coast to the Westman Islands. The first trip running completely on electricity was undertaken on the 1st of January 2020. 2. SÊvar, the ferry to HrÌsey. The ferry will be renewed as an electric ferry. It is expected that the design process can begin late in 2024. 3. SÊfari, the ferry to GrÌmsey. When the ferry needs to be renewed alternative energy sources than fossil fuels will be considered. Two ferries are privately owned. 4. The ferry in MjÛifjˆrur. This is a small ferry which the owner is interested in electrifying. 5. Baldur, the ferry in Breiarfjˆrur. This is a ferry owned by the company Eimskip/SÊferir. The ferry trips across Breiafjˆrur are supported by government funding 9 months of the year, but during the summer time Baldur sails under market conditions. When the next description for tender for the sailing of the ferry will be made, energy change will be encouraged."
Iceland,"Temporary tax subsidies which encourage people to use active modes of transportation, such as biking and walking, will be used to change people's commuting behaviour. The goal is to increase the share of active modes of transportation and enable more people to choose that option. Laws have already been updated and VAT on all bikes, electric bikes and electric scooters has been cancelled. The changes went through on January 1st 2020. The updated law states that all types of bikes should be subsidized if they will promote increased outdoor activity, improve public health and reduce road transport. The main goal is, however, to promote biking as a mode of transportation to reduce GHG emissions from road transport. Furthermore, since 2014 transport supplements to employees have been tax-free up to a certain limit if public or active modes of transportation are used."
Iceland,"Decrease GHG emissions from heavy goods transportation by accelerating energy change in that sector. GHG emissions per heavy vehicle (over 3,5 tonnes) are multiple times more than per passenger vehicle and they drive proportionately more. In the year 2018, approximately 15% of road transport emissions were caused by heavy goods transportation. Each additional sustainable vehicle is therefore significant. The main obstacles to energy change in heavy goods transportation are a lack of fuel supply and supply of longer distance vehicles, a lack of infrastructure and consequently a lack of demand for sustainable vehicles. It will be the role of a project management team on energy change to consult with stakeholders and get recommendations on which energy change projects should be the main focus to accelerate the switch to clean energy or sustainable fuels in heavy goods transport. The project management team will continue to work with the proposals made by GrÊna orkan in February 2020. The project management team will then put forward their suggestions on priority projects, including heavy goods transportation, for the years 2021-2023 by the 1st of December 2020. There are various ways to support progress in heavy goods transportation, such as tax exemptions, support for start-up projects or companies (pilot-projects), research grants, contributions to fuel production, infrastructure or direct equipment purchasing."
Iceland,"The use of fossil fuels in state owned ships other than ferries will be systematically reduced and ways to make them more sustainable will be evaluated. The possibilities for energy change in the patrol ship ﬁÛr, from the Icelandic Coast Guards, are already being analysed. The share of sustainable fuels, such as bio diesel will also be increased. Furthermore, a decision has been taken on building a new marine research ship and the tender for its build is currently being prepared. An emphasis was put on saving energy and limiting the environmental impact in the design process. Other energy saving methods in ships will also be used, such as using LED lighting and the cooling water for the diesel engine for heating. It is also assumed that the ship will be equipped with engines which can be powered not only by fossil-fuels, but also by bio fuels and possibly methanol. It will, however, be decided through the development process of a four-speed engine of the size required by the ship, whether it will be possible to equip it with such an engine. Land electricity will furthermore be used at harbour. It is expected that heat exchangers will be set up at the ships home harbour in order for the ship to be able to be heated with water from district heating. The measure is split between the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Industries and Innovation."
Iceland,"This measure has been expanded since the first Climate Action Plan (2018) and has become a separate measure. The goal was the implementation of EU Regulation No 517/2014 on F-gases with import quotas to reduce gradually the amount of F-gases coming to the country until 2036. The first regulation was adopted in December 2018 (Icelandic Regulation No 1279/2018) and repealed in 2020 with Icelandic Regulation No 1045/2020 which applies a quicker phase out of imported F-gases. Certain other provisions are made in the regulation which aim to further reduce F-gas emissions, such as limits on their marketing and use. Refilling big systems with F-gases which have a very high global warming potential (maximum 2500 GWP) are banned since 1st of January 2020. This regulation is an important step in reducing GHG emissions from the use of F-gases in Iceland. The Environment Agency is in charge of monitoring the regulation in line with provisions in the chemical law. Restrictions will be further increased if deemed necessary."
Iceland,Gradual ban on F-gases in passenger cars by enforcing the use of gases with a GWP lower than 150. It is implemented into Icelandic Regulation with Regulation No 822/2004.
Iceland,Operating permits for non-ferrous metals industries are required to take into account the Best Available Techniques (BAT) Reference Document (Art. 31(1) of the Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions).
Iceland,Operating permits for the manufacture of glass are required to take into account the Best Available Techniques (BAT) Reference Document (Art. 31(1) of the Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions).
Iceland,"The policy has been expanded since the first publication of the Climate Action Plan (2018) and has become a separate measure. The goal of this measure it to accelerate the process of phasing out F-gases by taxing imports of F-gases. The taxation was implemented into Icelandic legislation with Act on environmental and resource taxes in 2020. The tax is based on the polluter pays principle which stipulates that those who are responsible for pollution pay for the consequences of it. A similar approach is used in Iceland as has been used in Denmark, where a certain price is added per kilogram of F-gases for every tonne CO2e that it emits, up to a price ceiling of 10.000 ISK per kilogram. A taxation on F-gases can have a significant impact in a short span of time because more sustainable solutions are already available and itís fairly simple technologically to phase out F-gases."
Iceland,"Explore whether heavy industry in Iceland can systematically capture CO2 from their operations. The ÑCarbfixì or Ñgas to rockì method will be explored further, to determine whether it is a realistic option to capture CO2 emissions from heavy industry in Iceland. ReykjavÌk Energy (Orkuveita ReykjavÌkur) has developed the method in collaboration with the University of Iceland and foreign stakeholders and it has received widespread attention around the world. The method involves capturing CO2 from geothermal emissions. The CO2 dissolves in water under pressure and the water is subsequently pumped to a depth of 500-800 meters into the basalt strata, where the CO2 is permanently mineralized. The gas is, in this way, turned into rock. ON, a subsidiary of ReykjavÌk Energy, has used the method for the last years to reduce emissions from Hellisheii Geothermal Power Plant with good results. Recently Iceland implemented in the Icelandic law (No 12 from 18 March 2021) an Icelandic adaptation of Directive 2009/31/EC (the CCS Directive) with the aim to enable the EU ETS industry in Iceland to utilize the Carbfix method within the CCS."
Iceland,"Iceland will continue to participate in the ETS. New regulations have taken effect when the 4th period (2021-2030) of the system started in 2021. The stricter rules are designed to return a 43% decrease in emissions within the ETS in 2030 compared to 2005, start of the EU ETS. The goal has been further increased to 62% with the Fit for 55 package in December 2022. The trading system is the EUís main instrument in climate issues and is meant to create an economic incentive to reduce GHG emissions. Since the ETS was set afoot, it has been expanded every few years so that more sectors are included in the system and the rules have become stricter. The third period of the ETS came to an end by the end of 2020 and the fourth period, which covers the next 10 years, has taken over. With Act No 35/2021 the relevant changes on the Climate Act No 70/2012 were made to implement the appropriate EU regulations regarding the fourth period."
Iceland,"The aim of this measure is to provide farmers with comprehensive counselling and education on how they can reduce their GHG emissions and increase carbon sequestration on their farms and land through a special project called ÑClimate friendly farmingì (LoftslagsvÊnni landb˙naur). The goal is to reduce GHG emissions from farming and land use and increase carbon sequestration in soils and vegetation.  The preparation of the project has been managed by the Icelandic Agricultural Advisory Centre (RML), the Icelandic Forestry Association and the Soil Conservation Service of Iceland in collaboration with the Icelandic Sheep Farmers Association (Landssamtˆk saufj·rbÊnda), The Farmerës Association of Iceland (BÊndasamtˆk Õslands), The Ministry for the Environment, Energy and Climate and The Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries. The project was started in February 2020 with an open meeting for all farmers. Voluntary participants receive guidance on future planning, that focuses on reducing the carbon footprint of their farms and is based on data from each individual farm. In 2020, thirteen sheep farmers participated in the project. In 2021 this had expanded to forty-three participants, including fifteen cattle farmers. In 2022, the number of participators has reached to 54. One of the aims of the project is to include different types of farms and around 100 farms are expected to participate in 2023."
Iceland,"Reduced emissions from the enteric fermentation of ruminants will be achieved by improved feeding practices, which will be carefully monitored. Enteric fermentation is the process that causes methane emissions from the digestive system of livestock. It is the main source of GHG emissions from livestock and animal husbandry. When the livestock chew and process food they belch out methane. Research, that has been conducted abroad, indicates that it is possible to reduce methane production in the digestive system of livestock in various ways, such as through using substances made from algae. Whether it is possible to reduce emissions from enteric fermentation in Iceland through such means will be explored, and domestic research and development will be supported. The implementation of this policy is aligned with policy 401 on Climate-friendly agriculture and policy 404 on Carbon-neutral beef production, part of which is to assess the status and development of research on enteric fermentation. The project management team on the progress of climate action in agriculture will consequently be in charge of monitoring developments in this field and recommending measures that are suitable for Icelandic conditions when appropriate."
Iceland,"Emissions from fertilizer use in farming will be reduced by improving manure management practices and reducing the use of inorganic fertilizers. An emphasis will be placed on increasing farmersí knowledge and access to information on how best to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (CH4 and N2O) from agriculture. An important aspect of this effort is to enforce the regulation on protection against water pollution due to nitrogen compounds (NOx) from agriculture and other operations (Icelandic regulation No. 796/1999). The policy scope includes the fertilizer use of all farmers, but it will begin with cattle- and sheep farmers since measures in those fields have already begun (see policies 401 and 402). Through those measures farmers will, among other things, be provided with advice that aims to improve the use of manure, and it will be researched systematically how farmers use their manure. Knowledge and experience from this work will highlight the possibilities that exist to reduce GHG emissions with improved fertilizer use and lay a foundation for increased training and information sharing to other farming sectors. Consequently, it will be the project management group on climate action in agricultureís role to implement the policy for all farmers. As for progress, special effort in providing counselling on fertiliser use and for making fertilising plan was launched in 2021 following the increase in fertiliser price. In 2022, the fertiliser registration had been established and there is an on-going strategic planning to improve the utilisation of organic resource (e.g. for fertiliser use)."
Iceland,"GHG emissions from cattle breeding will be reduced and carbon sequestration at cattle farms will be increased. Efforts will be made to reach the target of making cattle farming carbon neutral no later than 2040. An emphasis will be placed on both reducing GHG emissions and increasing carbon sequestration. To reach the target, research, counselling and education for farmers will be increased. First, cattle farmersí knowledge on carbon emissions and sequestration, improved feeding and manure management techniques, will be built up. The foundation will be knowing the possibilities of each plot of farmland and to build up a transparent and certified framework for the project. The preparation for this project is ongoing and a management group with representatives from the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, the Ministry of the Environment, Energy and Climate and the Farmers Association of Iceland (BÊndasamtˆk Õslands) has proposed a variety of measures, in consultation with RML, The University of Agriculture, MatÌs (Icelandic Food and Biotech R&D) and more. The group handed in their recommendations in May 2020. It was proposed that part of the projects that will be undertaken now will, on one hand, improve the data that lays the foundation for the carbon inventory for cattle farming and, on the other hand, increase training and education for farmers on the possibilities to reduce their GHG emissions. Until the next review of the agricultural contracts in 2023, available funds should be utilised in two matters, to improve the foundational data for the carbon inventory for cattle farming and to increase training and education for farmers on the possibilities to reduce their GHG emissions. The group also emphasised that the funds that would be available after the 2023 review should be utilised in direct climate measures on the farms. The project management team on the agricultural contracts will be responsible for the financial allocation and will follow through on the projects."
Iceland,"The aim of this measure is to increase vegetable production in Iceland and promote carbon neutrality in horticulture. Production of Icelandic vegetables will be increased by 25% in the next 3 years. Organic vegetable production will receive increased financial support and efforts will be made for Icelandic horticulture to become carbon neutral no later than 2040. This was agreed upon when the contract for the operation conditions of horticulture production (horticulture contract)  was reviewed in May 2020. To support carbon neutrality in Icelandic horticulture by the year 2040, a part of the funding for the horticulture contract will be spent specifically on climate action. Knowledge on carbon emissions and sequestration will be increased, the treatment and use of resources and fertilisers will be improved, waste will be reduced, and an emphasis will be placed on effective agriculture, increased sustainability and other actions that support reaching the target of carbon neutral farming. A holistic approach will be undertaken, focusing on policy strategy in climate-, energy-, employment- and regional affairs, among other significant issues. Farmersí knowledge on climate issues, and possibilities to reduce carbon emissions and increase carbon sequestration, will be improved further. This will be achieved, partly by increasing farmersí access to direct council and education. The emphasis will be on knowing the possibilities of each individual horticultural farm directly, and to build up a transparent and certified framework for the project.  At the end of 2020, the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries and the Icelandic Association of Horticulture Producers (Samband garyrkjubÊnda) decided to fund two specific projects that the Icelandic Association of Horticulture Producers will manage. The projects are vegetation in the city and carbon sequestration. They will focus on increasing knowledge, public interest and participation in cultivation in order to increase carbon sequestration. The amount of vegetables produced is used as an indicator to monitor and evaluate the progress of this measure. Although being implemented in 2020, the evaluation started in 2021 as it was the first full executive year of measure. The total amount of produced vegetable in 2021 was 12,903 tons which is 8% lower than the average amount between 2017-2019. The decrease in total amount is due to crop failure in potato and turnip."
Iceland,"The measure is twofold. The first part announces a separate collection of bio waste and a ban on landfilling any waste that has been collected separately. Bio waste contains food-, kitchen- and garden waste which can biodegrade. The second part declares that landfilling all biodegradable waste will be banned in Iceland as a main rule. The first part of the measure is implemented from 1 January 2023, according to an amendment in 2021 to Act No 55/2003 on the Treatment of Waste (Lˆg um mehˆndlun ˙rgangs). One of the goals with this measure is to create conditions that support a circular economy. The provisions are meant to lead to the sorting of bio waste from other waste in the whole country and it being prepared for reuse or recycling, in line with the how the treatment of waste is prioritized. In the capital area bio waste will be diverted to the gas- and composting plant, GAJA, but in rural areas it is more likely that bio waste will be used for composting as a rule. The measure also includes banning the landfilling of biodegradable waste, though that regulation has not been approved yet by the Icelandic parliament."
Iceland,"This measure has been expanded since the previous Climate Action Plan (2018) and defined as an individual measure. Waste to be sent to landfills will be taxed to direct it to other treatment pathways which release less GHG emissions. The purpose of the tax is to encourage a decrease in the amount of waste that is currently sent to landfill in Iceland. The aim of the tax is to decrease total waste generation as well as encourage sorting. It is proposed that the tax be 15 ISK/kg of landfilled general waste, with the exception of inert waste for which 0,5 ISK/kg of landfilled waste is proposed. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs is currently collaborating with the Ministry of the Environment, Energy and Climate on a bill to change the law on environmental- and resource taxes, where the tax on landfilling waste will be legislated. The coalition of Icelandic municipalities will be consulted on the issue. This tax has not been implemented yet in the legislative system and is also not quantifiable due to a lack of data, thus, it is not included in the WEM projections scenario."
Iceland,"The goal of this measure is to systematically reduce food waste by encouraging several short term and long term projects. In the past years, several projects have been undertaken by the government, NGOs and companies to reduce food waste in Iceland, such as the creation of educational material, the organisation of events to raise public awareness, school projects and discount systems in stores for food products that are nearing the expiration date, innovation in using by-products from food production, a defined government policy and courses on the better use of food products. A survey on Icelandersí attitudes towards food waste has been undertaken to track changes in local public opinion. An analysis will be undertaken of possible unnecessary regulatory requirements on food products that have no impact on food safety but may be causing food waste.
The Minister of the Environment and Natural Resources formed a project team on food waste to create a holistic plan on effective measures against food waste. The team (which consists of representatives from consumers, the business sector, NGOs, young people, and the government) submitted a report including 24 proposed food waste reduction measures in June 2020 . Out of the propositions, the government will be responsible for implementing 14 of the measures and the business sector will be responsible for the remainder. The goal is to reduce food waste throughout the entire value chain by 30% in 2025 and by 50% in 2030."
Iceland,"A new gas and composting plant, GAJA, started operating at a small scale in the second half of 2020. It is the first plant of its kind in Iceland, and it will process municipal solid waste from households from the entire Capital Region, which contains around two thirds of Icelandís population. From 2025, the plant should process 30 kt of organic waste every year (max capacity: 40 kt, of which 10 kt is liquid waste) and produce 10 to 12 kt of compost and 1,100,000 Nm3 of CH4 each year."
Iceland,"Local authorities will be obliged to collect a fee for waste treatment as close as possible to the actual cost of the service in question, e.g., by targeting the amount of waste, type of waste, frequency of discharge, waste disposal or other factors affecting the cost of waste treatment. It will be possible to deviate from the principle in exceptional cases, e.g., if it is impossible to base the fee on real costs. At the same time, municipalities will be allowed to transfer real costs between waste categories in order to promote a circular economy. In this way, municipalities could encourage increased recycling by transferring the costs of collection and other treatment of recyclables to charging for the treatment of mixed waste. If a waste holder reduces his waste volume or sorts it properly, it will lead to a lower cost for him. This measure is included in an amendment in 2021 to Act No 7/1998 on Public Health and Pollution Control and took effect in January 2023."
Iceland,"In January 2023 an extended producerís responsibility will be introduced to all packaging that is not already under extended producerís responsibility, as well as on many other plastic products. These new items are, e.g., glass and metal packaging not intended for beverages, all timber packaging and single-use plastics."
Iceland,501 bans the landifilling of organic and biodegradable waste and measure 504 proposes the opening of a gas and composting plant accomodating partly the waste which cannot be landfilled anymore. Please find detailed information under 501 and 504.
Iceland,"Holistic mapping of the condition of grazing land and its use needs to be undertaken in order to evaluate the sustainability of current land use practices. The condition of the flora and soils on grazing land in Iceland have been mapped out. The goal was to perform such a complete mapping of the condition of grazing land regularly and develop sustainability indicators for the utilisation of the flora and soil resources of the country. The aim is for the result to be useful to manage grazing of land so that it ensures the protection of carbon in soils and flora and encourages increased carbon sequestration where carbon has been lost. The mapping occurs based on the project GrÛLind. The first part of the project has been to set up monitoring systems for the vegetation cover of land. Pastures have among others been mapped and a first edition of the mapping of grazing land was published in June 2020. A draft report on the status of soils and flora in Iceland was published at the same time. The project is based on the collaboration between the Soil Conservation Service of Iceland, the Sheep Farmers Association, the Icelandic Forest Service, and the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries. It is financed through agricultural contracts, although the Soil Conservation Service of Iceland takes care of its execution."
Iceland,"In the governmentís updated Climate Action Plan (2020) a great emphasis was placed on increasing carbon capture and storage in forests through afforestation. Forestry and afforestation were reinforced through increased government funding. A plan on afforestation was prepared on behalf of the government in line with the increased flexibilities afforded by higher financial contributions. Particular consideration was given to how sheep farmers and other farmers could be included in the afforestation efforts and other efforts that affect land use, in line with the provisions of the governmentís policy statement. In the plan, afforestation was to increase from 1,100 ha in 2018 to 2,300 ha in 2022. These plans have been reiterated and enhanced in the fiscal policy of the government for the years 2021 to 2025 where afforestation is planned to increase to 2,500 ha annually in the year 2025."
Iceland,"The goal of the measure is to promote increased soil reclamation to increase carbon sequestration from the atmosphere, stop soil erosion and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from land. Soil reclamation will be supported to increase carbon sequestration from the atmosphere, reduce greenhouse gas emissions from land and simultaneously support biodiversity. An extensive plan on improved land use in favor of climate change was presented in June 2019. The plan is for four years and actions described in it have already been started accordingly. In addition to carbon sequestration the actions are meant to work against land degradation and to support biodiversity. According to the plan the land reclamation should increase to 12,200 hectares per year starting from 2022, without taking natural succession into account. The scope of the project ìFarmers revegetate the landî (ìBÊndur grÊa landiî) should have tripled and the scope of projects supported by the ""Land Improvement Fund (""LandbÛtasjÛur"") should have doubled. Collaboration projects between the Icelandic Forest Service and the Soil Conservation Service of Iceland will be greatly reinforced, with an emphasis on reclaiming natural woodlands and heathland, such as in HekluskÛgarî. Land reclamation will be increased around the whole country and support for NGOs will be increased. The WOM scenario, estimated for this ex-ante assessment, does is without the policy defined by the Icelandic government. The WOM scenario is, therefore, based on the average of hectares restored during the revegetation activities that took place in the period 2017-2021. The WEM scenario is constructed on projections which include the policy defined in the ""Land and life"" (2022) report, where land reclamation is planned to increase to 10,000 hectares per year starting from the year 2022."
Iceland,"Law provisions on the protection of wetlands will be adhered to more strictly and monitoring of new draining will be increased further by requiring a construction permit from municipalities. The measure will be a collaboration project between farmers, landowners, municipalities, NGOs, companies, and others. Wetlands are protected by the law. At the same time as there is a major focus on reclaiming wetlands in Iceland, it is vital to prevent further draining of wetlands unless absolutely necessary. Collaboration between farmerës associations, municipalities and government organisations needs to be improved in order to ensure that the protection of wetlands is organised properly and that it will become the main rule that wetlands are protected instead of disturbed. The soil Conservation Service of Iceland and the Environment Agency of Iceland have been given the responsibility of proposing policies and measures to improve processes regarding this matter. Furthermore, the organisations will make proposals on how best to improve monitoring and data collection because of the measures which will be undertaken."
Iceland,"Wetland reclamation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from land. Wetland reclamation will be supported, as well as research on the impact of wetland reclamation and the draining of wetlands on greenhouse gas emissions. The benefits of wetland reclamation are not only reduced greenhouse gas emissions from land, but also for example better water distribution and more diverse bird life. In the first publication of the Climate Action Plan (2018) it was put forward that an extensive effort is required to restore wetlands, birch forests and scrubland, stop soil erosion and support further soil reclamation and afforestation in Iceland. Subsequently, the Ministry for the Environment and Natural Resources trusted the task of implementing this extensive effort to the Soil Conservation Service of Iceland and the Icelandic Forest Service, in close collaboration with the ministry. An extensive plan on improved land use in favor of climate change was presented in June 2019. The plan is for 4 years and actions described in it have already been started accordingly. The scope of wetland reclamation will be increased from 610 ha per year starting in 2022. This will be done through the project ÑWetland reclamationì, organised by the Soil Conservation Service of Iceland."
Iceland,"The aim of this measure is to improve the capacity in the LULUCF inventory and increase research to improve the premise for estimating emissions and sequestration from the LULUCF sector. An improvement plan, published in 2021, for the period 2020 to 2023, containing 20 improvement actions is ongoing. The goal of the plan is to strengthen the NIR and to ensure that Iceland fulfils its obligations to the UNFCCC and EU. A new improvement plan for the period 2024 to 2026 has already been drafted and it will be published in the end of 2023."
Iceland,"Carbon tax on fossil fuels. A carbon tax is imposed on fossil fuels. The carbon tax is a measure which reduces the use of fossil fuels, both in transport and from other sectors. Around the middle of the year 2019 and at the start of 2020, the Institute of Economic Studies at the University of Iceland worked on analysis of the impact of a carbon tax on the fossil fuel use of Icelandic homes and businesses, at the request of the Ministry for the Environment, Energy and climate. The analysis indicates that it is possible to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels, and thereby GHG emissions from fossil fuel consumption in Iceland, by imposing a carbon tax. According to the analysis homes reduce their fossil fuel consumption by approximately 0.35% when the price increases by 1%. The tax results in the homes using 1-2% less fossil fuels than otherwise. Businesses reduce their fossil fuel consumption by approximately 0.3% when the price increases by 1%. At the beginning of 2018 the carbon tax was raised by 50%, in line with the governmentës policy statement. The tax was raised  by 10% at the start of 2019 and again by 10% at the start of 2020."
Iceland,"The cost-effectiveness and environmental benefits of domestic fuel production will be assessed. In the cost-benefit analysis an emphasis will be placed on ensuring that all EU requirements on such production, including lower greenhouse gas emissions, would be fulfilled. Hydrogen, methane, methanol, ethanol and bio diesel are among the possibilities which will be explored. The report on domestic fuel production by the Minister of Industries and Innovation, which was mentioned in the first edition of the Climate Action Plan (2018), was submitted to parliament in April 2019. It contains an overview of domestic fuel production and knowledge in the field, and the possibilities for domestic production until 2030 has been assessed. In 2021, a report was published which analysed the feasibility of the production of e-fuels in Iceland. An additional analysis to determine the cost-efficiency of domestic fuel production and map the obstacles to utilising it will be undertaken. The results will be used to build a foundation for a guide to sustainable fuels in Iceland, i.e., which fuels are most cost-effective to use in which industry/operation, such as heavy transport and in ships, and to determine where more research is necessary. The project management team on energy change will receive the analysis and propose the next steps."
Iceland,"In the first edition of the Climate Action Plan (2018) a measure on the establishment of a Climate Fund (LoftslagssjÛur) was proposed. This action was continued in the 2020 Climate action plan. The fund formally started operating in 2019 and the Climate Act (Law no. 70/2012) has been updated and altered to further define and formalise its purpose. The Icelandic Centre for Research (RannÌs) has been entrusted with the management of the fund, a board has been established and allocation rules have been defined. 
The fund began accepting applications in November 2019 and the first grants were allocated to 10 innovation and 22 education projects in May 2020. The Climate Fund received 158 applications for the second allocation of funding in 2021. In total, 170 million ISK was allocated in grants to 24 projects: 12 educational projects and 12 innovation projects. In 2022 the fund received 85 applications, of which 12 projects were funded. The total amount allocated was 88 million ISK.
The fund was allocated 500 million ISK in grants to various such educational and climate innovation projects for the years 2019-2023. Further information on the Climate Fund can be found on its website (https://www.rannis.is/sjodir/rannsoknir/loftslagssjodur/)."
Iceland,"The government aims to set an example in climate policy and be a positive role model for organisations, businesses, and the public. The governmentís Climate Strategy (Loftslagsstefna StjÛrnarr·sins) is designed to reduce GHG emissions from all government operations and Ministries significantly and carbon offset the remaining emissions generously. 
The Icelandic government approved their Climate Strategy in April 2019 (government of Iceland) and there is an emphasis on reducing emissions from flights, vehicles, waste, energy use and cafeteria meals. The preparation for an updated Climate Strategy has started.
The policy directs the spotlight to the importance of organisations and companies reducing their carbon footprint and developing a climate policy. Furthermore, it increases demand for climate friendly solutions, such as sustainable taxis and rental cars, and effective transport contracts. A portal to connect emissions from flights to goals regarding reducing GHG emissions is also being developed and will be available to all government agencies. This measure is directly connected to the climate strategy of other public agencies (see measure 713)."
Iceland,"Iceland participates in the new international system, CORSIA (e. Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) which is meant to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation. The goal of CORSIA is to achieve a carbon neutral growth in international aviation from 2020 with carbon offsetting and carbon emissions through certain project certifications. The scope of CORSIA encompasses flight operators which emit more than 10 kt CO2 from international aviation from aircrafts with a maximum take of weight of over 5.700 kg.  CORSIA will be implemented in a few steps. Participation is voluntary, and Iceland will choose to participate from the beginning along with other countries that are a part of the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC). First, emissions from 2019 will be used as a baseline for emissions, and it will be mandatory to carbon offset all emissions that are in excess of the baseline in the following years. Then two three year periods begin (2021-2023 and 2024-2026) when all countries can participate voluntarily before participation becomes binding. Currently, 88 countries have committed themselves to participate voluntarily from 2021 to 2026. From the start of 2019, flight operators from these countries have been monitoring CO2 emissions from international aviation. The CORSIA system will be implemented in Iceland through the ETS with changes in legislation on climate issues."
Iceland,"Since the first edition of the Climate Action Plan (2018) was released the education material which is already available in Iceland has been mapped, with the goal of determining what kind of material is missing and where improvements can be made. The Ministry of Education and Children will use the mapping and further direct it to the Directorate of Education to use it to develop and revise education materials. It is expected that various educational projects will be presented in the near future (see measure 707 on climate education for the public), and that a part of them will be useful for the entire educational system.
When the education systemës curriculum is reviewed next, climate change education will be made a priority and educational grants will be allocated by the Ministry of Education and Children to climate education projects. Education on climate change will be increased at all educational levels and provided through various educational channels. The goal is for schools to be able to offer varied and comprehensive education on climate change, its consequences and what we can do to combat it, in line with the sustainability principle which lays at the core of all education. 
A contract has been signed with the NGO Landvernd on creating educational material on climate change and climate issues for schools. The education material is connected to the project Eco-Schools Iceland which has been running in Iceland since 2001 and currently reaches over 200 schools at all education levels. The project is part of to the worldís largest environmental education organisation, the Foundation for Environmental Eduaction (FEE)."
Iceland,"Education on climate issues will be supported in a variety of ways. Since the first edition of the Climate Action Plan (2018) was published, several new projects have been set afoot. The education system plays an important role in raising awareness in the younger generations and collaboration with education authorities is essential. Ways to further support education on climate issues, the impacts of consumerism and waste, will be explored. A mapping of the education material that is currently available to the public in Iceland has been undertaken by the Ministry of Education and Children and will lay the foundations for this.
One of the roles of the Climate Fund, which was established in the autumn of 2019 (see measure 703), is to support education on climate issues and the impacts of climate change. The government has, furthermore, directly funded several educational projects on climate issues and will continue to do so. Many education projects, organised by the government, organisations, NGOs, youth organisations, the media and others are also well underway.
In the Science and Technology Policy for the years 2020-2022 , there is a measure aimed at creating a framework and plan for how the public's access to evidence-based information and science is guaranteed in Iceland in the long term. Special efforts will be made to communicate knowledge in the field of climate issues with the aim to developing methods that can later be used in other fields."
Iceland,"The aim of this measure is to improve reporting on environmental data and information by operators in Iceland, including data on the use of raw materials, air pollutant- and greenhouse gas emissions. A regulation on the reporting of environmental data will be developed to coordinate information and simplify the reporting process for operators. The goal is to receive more detailed data from the operators that are bound to report environmental data, in order to have better information on resource use and pollution in Iceland. A regulation on îemissions accountsì (icel. ˙tstreymisbÛkhald), Regulation No 990/2008, will build on the same base as the Regulation on Green Accounts No 851/2002 and weave in further provisions to ensure that all data that the Environment Agency of Iceland needs to fulfil its legal obligations, such as reporting to EFTA's regulatory agency and the UNFCCC, is gathered and reported. The regulation on environmental data reporting is expected to apply to businesses that currently fall under the law on health and pollution prevention."
Iceland,"In 2018, the Minister of the Environment, Energy, and Climate entrusted the National Planning Agency (Skipulagsstofnun) with proposing an update to the National Planning Strategy (Landsskipulagsstefna) 2015-2026 (National Planning Agency, 2016) where a clearer policy on climate issues, landscape and public health would be defined in regard to planning operations. The National Planning Agencyís proposal was presented to the minister in the spring of 2021 (National Planning Authority, 2021).
The National Planning Strategy contains the governmentís policy and guidance for municipalitiesí planning. The policy update focuses on how the planning of municipalities can purposefully support the achievement of the governmentís climate, landscape, and public health targets. In the update, guidance is proposed on how municipalities can use long-term planning strategies to shape the development of land use and the built environment, both in rural and urban areas. The policy expects municipalities to form a policy on climate focused planning, for planning to support the achievement of carbon neutrality, and to strengthen resilience against climate change through various adaptation measures. In climate focused planning, climate goals are prioritised when settlements and land-use changes are being planned. In this way, planning can be used to support improved commuting behaviour, climate friendly construction, and the preservation and sequestration of carbon in soils and flora, for example .
The measure is connected to various other measures in the Action Plan, such as Measures 601, 602, and 604 on supporting forestry, land, and wetland reclamation, and measures 205, 206, and 209 on changed travel habits, active modes of transportation, and the strengthening of the public transport system."
Iceland,"Identify opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the building industry. Greenhouse gas emissions from the construction industry will be systematically reduced. It is difficult to assess the climate impact of the construction industry from the National Inventory, but the main emissions occur during construction and are caused by the choice and import of construction materials and the use of heavy machinery, for example to transport minerals. Only emissions from a small part of this, that is the use of heavy machinery, falls under Icelandës ESD emissions.  After the first edition of the Climate Action Plan (2018) was published, the Ministry for the Environment, Energy and Climate initiated a lot of research into the climate- and environmental impacts of the construction industry. Examples of the research which was undertaken include the climate impacts of the constructon industry, life cycle analysis, the treatment of waste and frost proof sustainable concrete. 
The results were published in early 2022. The emissions from the construction industry were estimated, where it was concluded that building materials are the largest contributor to emission from the industry. Emissions from the construction site, use during building lifetime and end-of-life were also estimated and measures were put forth to tackle each area of emissions, a total of 74 policies and measures."
Iceland,"The feasibility of issuing green government bonds and opening pathways to green investors for conventional government loans will be explored. There are possibilities to finance well defined sustainable projects through issuing certain green government bonds. This would send a clear signal to investors about the importance of environmental issues and how the finance sector could support climate change prevention. The issuing of green bonds has been increasing on international markets in the past years and there has been more pressure on investors to direct investment to projects that support reaching long term sustainability and climate targets.
The Icelandic Treasury has hitherto not issued green bonds, but a project management group set up by the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs is now assessing what possibilities are available.  The group was set up in June 2020 and consists of representatives from the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Ministry for the Environment, Energy and Climate, the Prime Ministerës Office, and the Central Bank of Iceland.
In 2021, the Ministry of Finance and Economy issued a financing framework for sustainable financing of the treasury and received a ""dark green"" rating from CICERO, an internationally recognized and independent certification body. Issuance of green treasury bonds under the sustainable financing framework is under consideration."
Iceland,"Sustainability will be taken into account in all public procurement as a main rule. The Central Public Procurement developed a new public procurement policy on Sustainable procurement which was published in January 2021. The government procures goods and services for 117 billion ISK every year, which allows for many opportunities to form a clear environmental policy regarding procurement. Creating a demand for more environmentally friendly goods and services can have significant direct and indirect effects on the market and help pave the way for other businesses or organisations to do the same thing.
The Icelandic government furthermore purchases food for approximately 3 billion ISK per year and can, as a big buyer, have a significant impact on food demand, support sustainable procurement, reduce the carbon footprint and support innovation. In the procurement policy for food for government agencies, which the Ministry of Industries and Innovation published in May 2019, an emphasis is placed on altering procurement processes so that cafeterias have access to package free food and that a public calculator for the carbon footprint of food will be designed. It has been declared that the goal is to keep the consumption of red meat in moderation. It has been ensured that the procurement policy for food and the policy on sustainable government purchasing will work together.
The Ministry of Finance and Economy issued a new procurement policy in April 2021 . It stipulates that the government's procurement is progressive and sustainable and takes environmental and climate considerations into account."
Iceland,"All government and public entities will be exemplary in climate policies. The Governmentës Climate Policy, which was approved in May 2019, puts a requirement on all government agencies, which was expanded further with updated climate legislation in June 2019. All government agencies, municipalities and government majority owned companies shall, by law, develop a climate policy and set itself a GHG emission reduction target. The EA has set out guidelines for the creation and implementation of climate policies for government agencies and companies majority owned by the state. 

Government organisations and government majority owned companies have the possibility to sign up for the project ìGreen steps in government operationsî (ìGrÊn skref Ì rÌkisrekstriî) . The EA has integrated the creation of a climate policy with the project Green steps in government operations and provides advice to government bodies on that level. Green accounting is useful with making a climate strategy, as government bodies can get a estimate of the emission of greenhouse gases in their operations. Various other aids have also been published on the Green Steps website to facilitate the process."
Iceland,"Legislative proposals will be specifically assessed based on their climate impact. To begin with, this will be done with selected bills in the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, but later it is aimed that this will apply to all bills that will be submitted to the parliament. 
It is important that the impact of legislation on the climate is assessed, and in this measure it is assumed that bills will be assessed specifically with regard to their climate impact, which includes a more detailed assessment of the impact on the environment and sustainable development. 
The Ministry of the Environment, Energy and Climate has begun work on a guidance criteria that are expected to be used to assess the climate impact of bills. It is proposed that each ministry evaluates its bills with regard to their impact on the emission of greenhouse gases. Thresholds, guidelines and methodologies that will be used to estimate annual greenhouse gas emissions will be established."
Poland,"The greenhouse gas emission allowance trading scheme (EU ETS), which has operated in the EU since 2005, covers installations  from the GHG emitting sectors of the economy (energy, industry) and aircraft operators (flights within the EU and EEA). All the installations and aircraft operators covered by the scheme must annually account for their greenhouse gas emissions with their emission allowances (EUAs)."
Poland,"The aim of the Programme is to commission in Poland nuclear power units with the total net capacity of 6-9 GW in six units located at two nuclear power plants, successively in the periods from 2033 to 2037 (EJ1) and from 2039 to 2043 (EJ2)."

Germany,"Funding for individual energy-efficiency measures in residential and non-residential buildings, as well as for complete renovations and new buildings at efficiency house/building level. Funding is provided in the form of low-interest loans in conjunction with a repayment subsidy or as a direct investment grant. The aim of this directive is to stimulate investment in energy-efficient construction and renovation measures that increase energy efficiency and the share of renewable energies in final energy consumption for heating and cooling in buildings in Germany and reduce CO2 emissions from the building sector in Germany."
Germany,Funding is available for refrigeration generators using non-halogenated refrigerants in stationary refrigeration and air-conditioning systems (including components and storage) as well as vehicle air-conditioning systems in buses and trains. Funding is provided on a grant basis with fixed amounts.
Germany,"Instead of the proportionate coverage of the heating and cooling energy demand by the use of renewable energies prescribed (by the GEG), the requirement pursuant to Section 10 (2) No. 3 may also be met by fulfilling stricter requirements pursuant to Section 16 in the case of a residential building and by fulfilling stricter requirements pursuant to Section 19 in the case of a non-residential building by at least 15 percent."
Germany,"""The technology used in agriculture and horticulture can be further improved in terms of its energy requirements. The federal program for energy efficiency in agriculture and horticulture will be continued and further developed for this purpose, and the use of renewable energies will be promoted.

Germany,"Funding is to be given for serial renovation, i.e. energy-related renovation with prefabricated elements. The measure aims for the acceleration of energy-related renovation with a simultaneous increase in the depth and speed of the renovations. At the same time, the start-up funding considered here facilitates the implementation of initial prototype series and the development of new renovation solutions which may make renovation faster and cheaper in future.
Consequently there may be substantial knock-on effects, i.e. renovation overall will become more economical and will be able to be implemented without additional funding. To accelerate this development, serially renovated efficiency houses and serially implemented particularly efficient individual measures should receive an incentive in addition to the current funding"
Germany,"Electric vehicles are currently subsidised with a purchase premium, known as the environmental bonus. The environmental bonus has been in force since july 2020 and has been increased and extended until 31.12.2024. This implemented the resolution of the coalition committee from 03.06.2020. For purely battery-driven electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles with a net list price of up to EUR 40 000, the environmental bonus was raised by 50% to EUR 6 000 and for vehicles over EUR 40 000 by 25% to EUR 5 000. For plug-in hybrids (externally chargeable hybrid electric vehicles) with a net list price of up to EUR 40 000, the environmental bonus was raised by 50% to EUR 4 500 and for vehicles over EUR 40,000 by 25% to EUR 3,750.

The requirements of Section 48 of the GEG are deemed to be met if the modified residential or non-residential building as a whole complies with certain minimum requirements for the annual primary energy demand relative to a reference building and for the specific transmission heat loss in the case of a residential building or the average heat transfer coefficient of the heat-transferring enclosure surface in the case of a non-residential building (Section 50 of the GEG).
Furthermore, the mandatory subsequent insulation of certain top floor ceilings in non-historic buildings (ß 47 of the GEG) and the operating ban for certain boilers older than 30 years (ß 72 of the GEG) were considered. In addition, information on heat recovery is included (ß 68 GEG)."
Germany,"The Federal Government will fund the development and large-volume scaling of electrolysis and refinery processes for the creation of electricity-based climate-neutral gases and fuels. These can be used directly in vehicles with combustion engines, for example in industry, chemistry and in air transport, heavy goods vehicle transport and shipping. The Federal Government will also create a National Hydrogen Strategy in the short term."
Germany,As yet unused potentials identified during energy audits and energy management systems will be implemented on the basis of a voluntary commitment.
Germany,"The energy tax and electricity tax laws regulate the taxation of various energy sources (e.g. fuel oil, petrol, diesel, natural gas, LPG, CNG) and electricity. Because of their price impulse setting effect, these taxes influence the behaviour of end consumers towards increased use of energy efficient technologies and careful use of energy."
Germany,"In the Climate Action Programme 203031 the Federal Government has
expressed the wish to introduce CO2 pricing for the transport and heating
sectors (non-ETS sectors) from 2021. The Bundestag already decided to
introduce such CO2 pricing with the National Emissions Trading System
(nEHS), based on the Fuel Emissions Trading Act (BEHG), in November 2019. An amendment to the act was required due to the findings of the conciliation committee concerning the tax laws and regulations for the implementation of the Climate Action Programme 2030. The first law amending the BEHG was passed by the Cabinet on 20 May 2020. The nEHS includes emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels, in particular fuel oil, liquid gas, natural gas, coal, petrol, diesel. Until 2025 a fixed price system will be introduced, which will be replaced by a price corridor in 2026. This creates a reliable price trajectory that enables the general public and industry to adjust to the progression."
Germany,"The Air Transport Tax Amendment Act (Federal Law Gazette I p. 2492) increased the statutory tax rates to EUR 13.03 for flights to destinations up to 2 500 km, EUR 33.01 for medium distance flights over 2 500 km up to 6 000 km and EUR 59.43 for long distance flights over 6 000 km."
Germany,"The funding is given in the form of a deduction in tax liability over a period of 3 years. 20% of investment costs are tax deductible, where 7% of eligible
investment costs can be deducted in each of the first 2 years and 6% in the

The condition for funding is that the respective energy-related measure has
been carried out by a specialist company. The minimum materials requirements
are set by the Energy Renovation Measures Regulation (ESanMV"
Germany,"The heavy goods vehicle toll is a usage-based levy for the use of major
roads by goods vehicles, which is based on the type of vehicle and the

Germany,"Flights are often cheaper than rail travel to the same destination. From a climate protection perspective, this is the wrong incentive. That is why the German government has presented a bill to increase the aviation tax from 2020 to the extent that, in return, the VAT on long-distance rail tickets can be reduced from 19 percent to the reduced VAT rate of 7 percent. This will make rail travel 10 percent cheaper."
Germany,"""Energy efficiency in buildings"" is promoted as follows: 
- Residential building energy consulting (on-site consulting, individual renovation roadmap (iSFP)) (EBW): Qualified energy consulting for residential buildings is intended to show property owners a sensible way to improve the energy efficiency of their building.
- Measures to provide energy advice to private households by the Verbraucherzent-ralen (vzbv): Across Germany, private households are advised on energy and energy efficiency in what are now around 740 advice centers run by the consumer centers and municipal support points (for example, in town halls) (various options are available for this. In addition to stationary advice, appointments can also be made at the property in question as part of the so-called basic check. 
- Energy consulting for non-residential buildings of municipalities and non-profit organizations (EBK): An important field of action of the program is the increase of energy efficiency in the public sector. The aim of the funding program is to make subsidized energy consulting available to local authorities, their own businesses, companies with a majority municipal shareholder background, as well as non-profit forms of organization and recognized religious communities, and to highlight economically viable investments in energy efficiency.
- Energy consulting for small and medium-sized enterprises: Economical energy use in companies can make a significant contribution to energy security in Germany and to global climate protection. This is the aim of the federal funding for energy consulting in SMEs (EBM). The federal government provides grants to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) take advantage of qualified energy consulting services. They are an important instrument for reducing information deficits, identifying savings potential and demonstrating measures for improving energy efficiency in the company. The starting points for energy consulting are the areas of buildings and systems as well as user behavior; the proposed measures should be based on the principle of economic efficiency. If the use of renewable energies appears to make sense, this should be pointed out in particular and, if necessary, a corresponding concept should be developed; this also applies to the use of waste heat."
Germany,"The electricity savings check is a project within the framework of the NKI of the BMWK. The project combines measures to reduce greenhouse gases (based on the electricity savings checks) in low-income households with labor market policy measures. Unemployed persons are qualified as so-called electricity saving helpers and prepared for entry into the regular labor market. There have been a number of follow-up projects to date, in each of which innovative elements have been developed and tested and, where appropriate, implemented on a permanent basis. The project duration is usually three years. Currently, the project ""Electricity Savings Check in Your Neighborhood"" is running (until March 31, 2023)."
Germany,"The Mittelstandsinitiative Energiewende und Klimaschutz (MIE) has been supporting companies in the energy transition since 01.01.13 and offers concrete assistance for small and medium-sized companies from trade and industry on the subject of energy efficiency and climate protection through qualification and networking projects. The companies are to receive concrete support by optimizing information and advice as well as intensifying further training, qualification and exchange of experience. The SME initiative is a joint project of the BMWK, BMUV, DIHK and ZdH. Half of the project volume was financed by the BMWK and the BMUV from the EKF with a 20 percent contribution from the project partners. To avoid mixed financing, the DIHK projects are funded by the BMU and the ZDH projects by the BMWK. The MIE was extended in 2021 until the end of 2022 to make up for corona-related delays in individual work packages."

Germany,"Since the beginning of 2016, consumers have been informed of the efficiency status of their old heating installations by the national efficiency label. At the start of 2016, labelling of the installations was performed on a voluntary basis by chimney sweeps, heating engineers or energy consultants under existing contractual relationships. Since the beginning of 2017, district chimney sweeps have been obliged to label installations that are older than 15 years and have not yet been marked as part of the regular combustion system inspection. Owners of heating systems must accept this labelling. With the labelling they receive an individual confirmation of the efficiency class of the heating installation, an information brochure containing additional information about the federal consultancy service and funding scheme in the area of heating systems, and also verbal information about the energy efficiency of the heating installation. This label and the information provided should encourage the owners of heating systems to carry out an energy consultation or replace the old installation"
Germany,"On September 14, 2020, the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection (BMWK) and the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, together with 21 industry associations and organizations, agreed to continue and further develop the Energy Efficiency Networks initiative. The initiative, which has been further developed into an energy efficiency and climate protection network, will start in January 2021, with the aim of establishing up to 350 new networks by the end of 2025 and thus saving up to six million tons of greenhouse gas emissions. Climate protection aspects will play a greater role in the networks than before. An energy efficiency and climate protection network consists of 8 to 15 companies. Each company develops a savings target and individual measures with the help of an experienced energy consultant. In a professionally supervised exchange of experience, the companies set a common goal for their network work on this basis."

Sweden,"Public investment in climate-related research and development are aimed at creating better prerequisites for achieving the substantial longer-term emissions reduction required. Swedish climate related research covers a broad spectrum, from natural sciences to humanities, but with an emphasis on technical and scientific research and development. Three important research areas are energy, transport and industry, for which the Government has decided to grant extensive funding. Energy and climate issues are closely linked, and the solutions to the challenge of climate change are largely energy related. The overall objective of energy research and innovation in Sweden is to contribute to fulfilling the national energy and climate objectives, the long-term energy and climate policy, and energy related environmental objectives.  

In the budget bill for 2017 , which was approved by the Swedish Parliament, the government proposed an expansion of contributions to energy research and development with funding of SEK 620 million for 2017ñ2020. This resulted in a level of SEK 1.6 billion in 2020, compared with the earlier level of SEK 1.3 billion. The Government's budget bills for 2021 and 2022 allocated SEK 1.57 billion and 1.43 billion respectively . Estimated amounts for 2023 are SEK 1.48 billion."
Sweden,"Among other aspects, the Environmental Code contains general rules for consideration to be observed in all activities and measures that are not of negligible significance in individual cases and that can affect the environment. Environmentally hazardous activities, as defined in the 9th chapter, require obtaining a permit. The permit application must include an environmental impact assessment as described in the 6th chapter. In 2018 changes were made in the 6th chapter in order to clarify that direct, indirect and cumulative impacts should be included in the environmental impact assessment. Greenhouse gas emissions form part of the permit assessment procedure and the Code also includes requirements to use the best available technology. However, effective 2005, issuing permits including emissions limit values for carbon dioxide or limiting the use of fossil fuels for installations covered by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme is no longer permitted."
Sweden,"Swedish governmental authorities have long experience of using communication of knowledge as policy instruments. Some examples: 

The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency is a driving force and provides support in climate work in Sweden. The web-site www.naturvardsverket.se is a hub for statistics and facts on emissions and knowledge on effective mitigation activities, widely used by policymakers, media, business, organizations and researchers. 

The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) develops and distributes information about the weather, water and climate change adaptation. The National Knowledge Centre for Climate Change Adaptation, set up at SMHI launched the Swedish Portal for Climate Change Adaptation, with facts and guidance on adaptation to a warmer climate. 

The Swedish Energy Agency is responsible for giving both citizens and busi-nesses information and advice on more efficient energy use. On-line energy tests; the websites where you find energy tests of white goods for consumers, are the most visited on the Swedish Energy Agencyís web. The Swedish Energy Agency organizes local energy and climate advisers in Swedenís municipalities free of charge to answer questions about heating, energy costs and efficiency, transport, climate, government grants relating to energy."
Sweden,"The aim of the energy tax is mainly fiscal. It does also have the effect to steer energy usage towards Swedenís energy efficiency, renewability and climate targets . The energy tax on motor fuels used in road vehicles and off-road machinery also internalises external costs from the traffic, such as road wear, noise, etc.  
The energy tax on fuels varies depending on whether it is used as motor fuel or for heating purposes. The tax level on heating fuels also varies between industry, households and the energy conversion sector."
Sweden,"A carbon dioxide tax, based on the fossil carbon content in the fuel, was in-troduced in 1991 and aims at reducing the emissions of carbon dioxide in sectors outside the EU ETS. The tax has been raised in several steps since it was first implemented. In total, the tax has increased from SEK 0.25/kg (1991) carbon dioxide to SEK 1.22/kg (2022). In addition to specific tax increases stipulated in Government bills, a yearly indexation of the tax level is applied.  

The tax level is proportionate to the calculated amount of carbon dioxide emissions, based on the fuelís fossil carbon content. This means that biofuels currently are not subject to carbon taxation, if not used within the reduction obligation scheme for motor fuels. With regard to motor fuels, changes to carbon taxation of biofuels were implemented on 1st July 2018 (see separate section on carbon and energy taxation in the transport sector). 

Due to the risk of carbon leakage, a reduced carbon tax is applied for diesel used in agriculture, forestry and aquaculture."
Sweden,"At present, about 760 Swedish installations are included in the system. National legisalation is implemented through the Ordinance (2004:1205) on emissions trading."
Sweden,"An electricity certificate system supporting electricity production based on renewable energy was introduced in 2003. Conceptually, the system works as follows. Electricity producers are allocated a certificate from the central government for every megawatt-hour (MWh) of renewable electricity produced. Electricity suppliers are obliged by law to submit electricity certificates corre-sponding to a certain share, or quota, of their electricity deliveries. The quota was gradually increased until 2020. The producers sell the certificates in a market where the price is set by the seller and buyer (normally an electricity supplier). The certificates thereby provide an extra revenue for the producers of renewable electricity . 
 
Since 2012, Sweden and Norway have a common electricity certificate market. The increase of renewable electricity production through the electricity certificate system has been a key element in attaining Swedenís renewables targets. The electricity certificate system was earlier prolonged until 2045  but the rapid expansion of renewable electricity production has led to the elec-tricity certificates now fulfilling only a limited function. Therefore, new electricity generation facilities are not eligible for electricity certificates after the end of 2021 and the electricity certificate system will be terminated by the end of 2035."
Sweden,"Research programs 
Different programs have promoted the dissemination of knowledge and information about wind power.
 
Designation of areas of national interest for wind power 
Since 2004, certain land and water areas in Sweden have been designated as areas of national interest for wind power. There are 313 such areas in Sweden, of which 284 are located onshore and 29 offshore. The total area of these national interests for wind power is 7,600 km2, repre-senting about 1.5% of the countryís land area, including Swedish waters. 
 
A national strategy for sustainable wind power expansion 
The Swedish Energy agency and the Swedish Environmen-tal protection agency have jointly developed a national strategy for sustainable wind power expansion, which was presented in January 2021. The strategy, which only covers land-based wind power, contains a regional distribution of a national development needs and a national planning basis. Since January 2021 the focus has been on implementing the strategy. 

Local and regional efforts for renewable electricity production
During 2022 most projects within the program Local and regional efforts for renewable electricity production have come to their conclusion. 

Offshore wind power
To promote development of offshore wind power, the government has assigned the Swedish Energy Agency the role of coordination in finding areas for another 90 TWh of yearly electricity production from offshore wind pow-er compared to the current marine spatial plan."
Sweden,"A subsidy for installations of solar power systems was initiated in 2009. The budget for this support was around SEK 4 billion for the period 2016ñ2020. All types of actors could obtain financial support for installing grid-connected solar electricity and solar hybrid systems. The investment support contributes to an increased electricity production from solar power systems and to business development of solar energy technology. The support ended 31 December 2020 and has for private individuals been replaced by a tax deduction for green investments. Municipalities and companies were eligible to continued support in 2021 for the installation of solar cells and energy storage. The subsidy was lowered to 10 percent with the aim to end after 2021, as the Government's assessment is that there is no longer a long-term need for support."
Sweden,"Building regulations have been used since the 1960ís to set minimum requirements for energy use in new buildings in Sweden. Since 2009, building regulations for new production have included stricter requirements for electrically heated buildings. Stricter requirements for energy use in new buildings with other heating systems took effect in 2012. Regulations include require-ments for specific energy use (kWh/m2 per year) and average thermal transmittance (W/m2K)."
Sweden,"Technology procurement is an instrument designed to initiate a market transition and disseminate new, more efficient technology, such as new products, systems and processes. Network-based procurement of technology is an approach that encompasses the entire decision-making process, from feasibility study and purchaser group, to specification and dissemination of requirements and further development of more energy-efficient technology. It is being used in areas like heating and control, ventilation and lighting. The Swedish Energy Agency coordinates procurement networks for housing (BeBo), commercial and institutional premises (BeLok), small houses (BeSmÂ), food distribution (ReLivs), and new construction of, and conversion to, energy-efficient buildings (L≈GAN)."
Sweden,"Energy labelling is mandatory for the product groups that are regulated by the Energy Labelling Directive (2010/30/EU) and applies to all EU member states. Energy labeling makes the product's energy use visible and facilitates for consumers who want to make energy smart choices.  
 
The Ecodesign Directive (2009/125/EC) aims to improve the productsí environmental performance during their full life cycle. The requirements act as a floor to prohibit and remove the very worst products on the market, seen from an energy perspective. In principle, these rules can be applied to all energy-related products (except transport) and cover all energy sources. Sweden is particularly active in market surveillance activities, involving laboratory tests of products as well as supervision of distributors. The directive has been implemented in Sweden through the Ecodesign Act (SFS 2008:112)."
Sweden,"The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is a framework within which the EU Member States have decided on measures to help reaching the overall goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the EU Member States and to secure the energy supply in the medium and long-term by improving energy efficiency in new and existing buildings. The framework includes setting min-imum energy performance requirements for new buildings and building parts, including requirements to promote improving energy efficiency when renovat-ing existing buildings and building parts, implementing a system for issuing energy performance, certificates for buildings and inspections or advice on boilers and air conditioning systems.  The directive has been implemented in Sweden through the Swedish Planning and ¥Building Act (SFS 2010:900) and through the Law on energy performance certificates for buildings (SFS 2006:985). The directive is part of the ìFit for 55î package and is currently under negotiation."
Sweden,"Swedish Regulation 2016:1128 on fluorinated greenhouse gases complements the EU regulation. Provisions in Sweden, for cooling and air conditioning and heat pump equipment include: 
 
ï	requirements on leak checks in conjunction with installation, reconstruction and other interventions  
ï	requirements on leakage checks and certified competence, also applying to mobile equipment containing f-gases  
ï	the results of periodic inspection must be reported to the supervisory authority  
ï	the supervisory authority must be informed before the installation of equipment containing more than ten kilograms of refrigerants  
ï	it is prohibited to sell f-gases as refrigerants to recipients other than those laid down in Regulation  
ï	Upon disposal, importers and those who transfer refrigerants are required to take back any refrigerants that they delivered, free of charge, and to provide containers for this purpose.  
 
Equipment manufactured, imported or brought into Sweden shall be provided with accurate and easy-to-understand operating and maintenance instructions."
Sweden,"Manufacturers selling vehicles in the EU are subject to EU regulations (Nos 2019/631) that set emission performance standards for new passenger cars and vans, as part of the Communityís integrated approach to reducing CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles. Under these regulations, new passenger cars should not emit an average of more than 95 g CO2/km from 2020. New vans should not emit an average of more than 147 g CO2/km from 2020. New standards for 2025 and 2030 were adopted by the EU during 2019. Accordingly, CO2-emissions from new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles are to be reduced by 37.5 percent and 31 percent respectively by 2030 compared to emission targets in 2020. In 2019 the EU also adopted CO2-emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles. Emissions from new heavy-duty vehicles in 2025 are to be 15 percent below the average for 2019, and 30 percent lower compared to 2019 by 2030."
Sweden,"The carbon dioxide tax level is proportionate to the calculated amount of carbon dioxide emissions on the basis of the fuelís fossil carbon content. This means that biofuels are not subject to carbon taxation, if not used within the reduction obligation scheme for motor fuels. High-blended and pure biofuels are not covered by the reduction obligation scheme and such sustainable biofuels are still exempted from both the carbon tax and the energy tax from July 2018."
Sweden,"The availability of renewable fuels has been subject to legislation requiring that filling stations with annual sales of petrol and diesel above a specified level must supply at least one kind of renewable fuel. The law became effec-tive 1 January 2006. This requirement has resulted in an increased number of mainly E85 pumps. As of 1 January 2015, the legal requirements were loos-ened so that filling stations selling more than 1,500 m3 of petrol or diesel must supply at least one kind of renewable fuel."
Sweden,"Since 2006, Sweden has differentiated the annual vehicle tax with respect to the vehicleís carbon dioxide emissions per kilometer. For older vehicles the tax is dependent on weight. The CO2-related vehicle tax is SEK?22 per g?CO2/km beyond 111?g?CO2/km in mixed driving. This CO2 component is multiplied by a factor of 2.37 for diesel cars, since diesel fuel has a lower energy tax than petrol. Cars adapted for alternative fuels such as ethanol and gas, except LPG, are taxed at a lower rate of SEK?11 per g?CO2/km beyond the first 111 g?CO2/km. Light trucks, light buses and campers were also brought into the system of CO2-differentiated vehicle taxation as of 2011. The taxation of older cars and heavy trucks is mainly based on weight. The main purpose of the differentiation is to make car buyers chose cars with a low climate im-pact.  

The system applies to cars sold before the bonus malus system was introduced on 1 July 2018, and will also apply again for cars ìleavingî the bonus malus system three years after purchase. Light diesel vehicles will keep the fuel sur-charge from the bonus malus system instead of the fuel factor of 2.37."
Sweden,"Company-registered cars represent about 50% of new car registrations in Sweden. Approximately 50% of these cars are cars that are registered in the name of a company and made available to employees for private use. The benefits of private use of a company car are subject to personal income taxes. The taxable value of the benefit corresponds on average to the market value of owning the car.  
Fuel provided by the employer is taxed separately. The value of the fuel benefit corresponds to 1.2 times the market value of the cost of fuel. Hence, employees have an incentive to choose more fuel-efficient cars and to limit the private use of company cars.  

To increase the incentive to purchase company cars that use environmental technologies, green cars such as electric cars and plug-in hybrids receive relatively favorable tax treatment through a reduction of their taxable value.     
 
In 2021 adjustments were made for taxable values to better reflect the market values, which meant that private use of company cars became slightly more costly than before."
Sweden,"The programme period 2023-2027 will support the transition to more sustainable production systems and has been adapted to EU laws and commitments in the area of environment and climate. This will address the climate impact from agriculture.†The Strategic plan for implementation of the common agricultural policy in Sweden 2023-2027 includes several measures that are expected to contribute to reaching environmental and climate targets in line with measures within CAP during the current period. 
The Swedish plan will use 30 percent of the EU financial contribution to support environmental and climate objectives focusing on on carbon sequestration, biodiversity and valuable grasslands, as well as increasing knowledge about sustainable production. As an example of a climate measure, farmers may receive support via eco-schemes for cover crops with the aim of increasing carbon sequestration. Another example is support for investments to reduce emissions of ammonia and greenhouse gases from stables and manure management."
Sweden,"Since 2001, there is a free advisory service for farmers called ìFocus on nu-trientsî (in Swedish: Greppa N‰ringen), which is financed by the current rural development programme. The initial focus was on advice for higher nutrient efficiency in order to reduce nutrient leaching. Today, it also provides advice specifically targeting greenhouse gas emission reductions and energy efficiency."
Sweden,"Until 2014 the agriculture, forestry and aquaculture sectors paid 30% of the general energy and carbon dioxide tax rates for fossil fuel used for heating purposes. Since then, the carbon dioxide tax reduction in the sectors has been reduced in steps. Carbon dioxide tax in these sectors was increased to 60% of the standard rate in January 2015 and to 80% in January 2016, and the carbon dioxide reduction was then totally abolished on 1 January 2018. The Government proposed in its budget bill for 2021 to totally rescind the reduction of energy tax on heating fuels for agriculture, forestry, and aquaculture in two steps. The approved proposal came in effect on 1 June 2021. In its budget bill for 2023 the Government proposed that the measure be in effect throughout 2023. 
A special reimbursement for carbon tax on diesel for machinery in agricultural, forestry and aquaculture activities was lowered gradually from SEK 2.10 per liter (2011) to SEK 0.90 per liter in 2015. Reimbursement levels have been changed during the years. From the 1 January 2020 the reimbursement for carbon tax on diesel for machinery in agricultural, forestry and aquaculture activities was SEK 1.93 per liter. In 2022 and 2023, the tax rates for diesel for machinery in agricultural, forestry and aquaculture activities, have been changed in various steps."
Sweden,"The Swedish Forest  Policy (as of 1993) has two overarching, equal objectives: the production objective and the environment objective. 

Under the Forest Policy, there are no production subsidies, and forest owners have considerable freedom and responsibility to independently conduct long-term sustainable forest management. The regulations in the Forestry Act concerning timber production cover the notification of felling, the lowest age for felling, requirements for reforestation, requirements for environmental protec-tion in guidelines for thinning and measures to limit damage, including regula-tions to prevent insect damages. No forest management activities are allowed on forestland with lower productivity, so called non-productive forest land. Special regulations apply to certain types of forests, such as subalpine forests and deciduous forests. Examples of regulations concerning nature conserva-tion and cultural heritage include not disturbing important biotopes, buffer zones and arable land, and leaving older trees, high stumps and dead wood in situ. Sustainable forest management influences carbon dioxide removals and emissions in various ways, through the production of renewable raw materials that can replace fossil fuels and materials that generate emissions of green-house gases in both Sweden and in countries importing forest products from Sweden, while maintaining or increasing carbon stocks in biomass, soils and harvested wood products."
Sweden,"The Swedish Environmental Code chapter 11 contains regulations on land drainage, which can be used to reduce emissions from peat soils with large carbon stocks. Land drainage measures are actions taken to remove water from soil or protect against water. In order for the measure to be a land drain-age measure according to the Environmental Code, the purpose of the measure is to permanently increase the soil's suitability for a specific purpose, such as cultivation, development, peat cover, road construction, garden plant or golf courses.  
 
In central parts of the southern Swedish highlands and north of the limes norrlandicus (the biogeographical boundary of northern Sweden), drainage may only be undertaken with a permit. In the rest of the country, and on sites specially protected under the RAMSAR Convention, such schemes are prohibited. Land drainage has decreased since the beginning of the 1990s and is now occurring only to a very limited extent."
Sweden,"In Sweden, forests and land are allocated for the conservation of biodiversity, nurture and preserve valuable natural environments, protect, restore or create valuable natural environments and for outdoor recreation. These measures in the form of nature reserves, nature conservation agreements, are also positive for carbon stocks in forest biomass and soil carbon within the boundaries of the allocated areas by allowing the carbon stocks to increase. 
 
Nature reserves  
In Sweden, nature reserves  are one of the most common ways of protecting valuable nature in the long term. At present, there are close to 5,000 nature reserves in Sweden. The seventh chapter of the Environmental Code contains the regulations for the establishment of nature reserves. The work of establishing nature reserves is led by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. 
 
Nature conservation agreements  
Nature conservation agreement is a civil law agreement . The property owner and the state or a municipality agree on a certain financial compensation for the property owner, for example, to refrain from logging. The Swedish Forest Agency and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency cooperate in their implementation."
Sweden,These PAMs have been evaluated as a group of PAMs
Sweden,"To further stimulate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, a program for local investments was introduced in 2015 called the Climate Leap. Since 2015, SEK 12 billion has been granted for investments within the program (as of September 2022). The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and the County Administrative Boards administer the grants. Investments in all sec-tors, except those included in the EU ETS, and all types of organizations are eligible to apply for grants. Some investments in sectors included in the EU ETS are also eligible for grants if these result in an increased utilization of waste heat. Applicants compete based on the estimated greenhouse gas reduc-tion per invested SEK. Examples of investments that can be granted support are charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, biogas plants, recycling facili-ties, infrastructure for biofuel distribution and transitions from fossil to re-newable heat sources. In 2021, the combined budget for the program amount-ed to SEK 1,955 billion. The budget increased to SEK 2,755 billion in 2022, 3,055 billion in 2023 and another 5 billion for the period 2024ñ2026. This budget is combined for the Climate Leap and the grant for investment in non-public EV chargers."
Sweden,"A tax reduction for households and businesses was introduced in 2015 to stimulate investment in the micro-production of renewable electricity. The income tax reduction is SEK 0.60/kWh of renewable electricity fed into the grid in a connection point with a fuse size of up to 100 Amps but limited to the amount of electricity received from the grid in the same connection point. The tax reduction is capped at SEK 18,000 per year."
Sweden,"The Swedish Energy Agency is responsible for a capacity building program in the area of building for low energy use. The program target different construc-tion stakeholders, such as architects, engineers, technicians, installers and site managers"
Sweden,"The law on energy audits in large enterprises aims at promoting improved energy efficiency (SFS 2014:266). The law requires large enterprises to conduct energy audits, including information of total energy use, as well as proposals of cost-efficient measures to improve energy efficiency. An audit must be conducted at least every four years."
Sweden,"Municipalities are eligible to apply for the cost of climate and energy counselling (SFS 2016:385). The counsellor provides targeted advisory services to households, associations and small and medium-sized enterprises. The counselling activities aim to increase energy efficiency, promote renewable energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The service is provided by the municipalities, free of charge and commercially independent. During the period 2021-2023, 288 out of 290 Swedish municipalities offer this service to citizens and businesses.
 
In the budget bill for 2023, the Government has allocated SEK 120 million for the municipal energy and climate counselling service."
Sweden,"Urban environment agreements is a scheme for investments in public transport and cycling infrastructure at the regional and local level in Sweden. The scheme commenced in 2015. The aim of the scheme is to promote sustainable urban environments and the measures should lead to energy-efficient solu-tions with low greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to achieving the envi-ronmental quality goal Good built environment. Initially, the national plan for the transport system 2018-2029 had SEK 1 billion allocated per year to the urban environmental agreements. In the budget bill for 2023 the Government adjusted this to SEK 775 million during 2023 and 540 million during 2024 and SEK 540 million during 2025. 
Municipalities are eligible to apply for grants to cover part of the investment costs for public transport, cycling and freight measures. The measures should be coupled with other actions aiming at increasing the long-term sustainability of urban areas and the transport system. These actions can include increased accessibility through public transport, urban planning for housing or increased cycling and walking, lower vehicle speeds, parking policies and pricing. The scheme is administered by the Swedish Transport Administration."
Sweden,"Since January 2020 regional public transport agencies, public transport com-panies, municipalities and limited companies  are eligible to apply for climate premiums for electric buses, electric and renewable-fuelled heavy-duty vehi-cles as well as for electric tractors and mobile machinery. The budget for these premiums was SEK 170 million for 2021, 1 600 million 2022 and 462 million for 2023."
Sweden,"In January 2015, the Government introduced a support scheme for biogas production through anaerobic digestion of manure. The support aims to in-crease biogas production from manure and thereby gain two-fold environmen-tal and climate benefits through reduced methane emissions from manure and the substitution of fossil energy.  The increased digestion of manure offers several environmental benefits. It reduces both emissions of greenhouse gases and eutrophication of fresh and marine waters, as well as produces biogas for energy. The biogas generated can be used to generate electricity or heat, or as vehicle fuel. The subsidy amounts to a maximum of 0.40 SEK/kWh of biogas produced. In the latest support period, 1 October 2019 until 30 September 2020, a total amount of SEK 29,9 million was shared among 65 biogas plants generating 178 GWh. Support for investments in new biogas plants can also be granted through the Rural Development Pro-gram. 
New support from 2022 which is partly new and which replaces the previous Investment support for biogas. Means that the producer of biogas can receive support, if the biogas is upgraded to a quality that allows input into the distribution network for natural gas or that upgrades biogas to vehicle gas."
Sweden,"The Rural Network complements the Swedish Rural Development Program, the Ocean and Fishery Program, and the program for local leadership development in the Social fund and Regional fund. The network brings together actors at the local, regional and central levels for exchanging information and experiences. The network is intended to reinforce implementation of these programs. The Swedish Board of Agriculture has been given responsibility by the government to monitor the Rural Network."
Sweden,In 2000 a tax of 250 SEK per tonne landfilled waste was imposed on waste disposal to landfill (SFS 1999:673). The landfill tax has been in-creased gradually and was 573 SEK per tonne landfilled waste in 2022.
Sweden,"Under the Swedish Ordinance on the Landfill of Waste (SFS 2001:512), a ban on landfilling combustible materials was introduced in 2002 and a similar ban was imposed for organic material in 2005. The ordinance also regulates the collection and disposal of methane gas from landfills. The ordinance is in-tended to prevent and reduce adverse effects on human health and the envi-ronment from landfilling."
Sweden,"A set of ordinances mandates extended producer responsibility for producers of ten product groups. Producer responsibility promotes sorting, collection and recycling of certain waste flows . Producer responsibility aims to incen-tivize producers to develop more resource-efficient products that are easier to recycle and do not contain environmentally hazardous substances. It also aims to reduce the amount of waste. The legislation on extended producer respon-sibility contains national targets for recycling, and has resulted in increased separated collection of waste fractions and increased recycling (apart from pharmaceuticals and radioactive products, where there are no specific tar-gets)."
Sweden,"Since 1991, there has been a requirement that all the municipalities in Sweden must have their own municipal waste plan. A Swedish EPA regulation (NFS 2006:6) sets out the minimum requirements of what each municipality must include in its waste plan, such as a description of the current situation, recy-cling plants and landfills, environmental assessment, measures and monitor-ing. Both the national waste plan  and the national prevention program  act as guidance for the municipalities in developing their local plans and deciding on prioritized actions."
Sweden,"The Industrial Leap is a long-term reform which began in 2018 and continues until 2040. It consists of a government scheme  aiming to support development of technology and processes to reduce the process-related GHG emissions in Swedish industry. Financial support, administered by the Swedish Energy Agency, may be provided for, i.g., research, pilot projects as well as full-scale investments. Projects related to mitigation, as well as to negative emissions, are eligible for funding. The target group for support is industries with process-related emissions, along with universities and research institutes.  

The scope of the Industrial Leap was amended 2020 when support for measures leading to negative emissions such as BECCS was added.  
 
In 2018, the government budgeted SEK 300 million for the program, while in 2019 the budget was increased to SEK 500 million followed by another in-crease in June 2020 to SEK 600 million for the period 2020-2022.  
 
In December 2020 the Government decided to further extend the purpose of the grant to also be able to finance research, feasibility studies and invest-ments relating to other greenhouse gas emissions, such as certain combustion emissions and diffuse emissions, linked to process-related emissions and stra-tegically important initiatives in industry that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Further, the grant was increased by SEK 150 million in 2021 and is expected to increase by SEK 100 million in 2022."
Sweden,"A tax on air travel was introduced 1st April 2018. The tax aims to reduce the climate impact of aviation. The tax is regulated in the Swedish act SFS 2017:1200 regarding tax on air travel. It is designed as a tax on commercial flights and is paid for passengers travelling from a Swedish airport. The airline that carries out the flight is liable to tax. Various levels of tax are levied based on the final destination (for 2020: SEK 62, 260 or 416), with a yearly indexa-tion. The Swedish Tax Agency is the competent tax authority."
Sweden,"In July 2018, a greenhouse gas emission reduction obligation for petrol and diesel in conjunction with fuel tax reforms, called the Fuel Change, was im-plemented. The emission reduction obligation establishes an obligation on petrol and diesel suppliers to reduce life-cycle carbon dioxide emissions, by gradually increasing blending with sustainable biofuels. The Reduction obligation scheme makes an important contribution to the phasing out of fossil fuels in road transport. The obligation replaces the for-mer tax exemption for low-blended biofuels, i.e. biofuels covered by the scheme will be subject to the same tax rate per liter as fossil equivalents.
 
Level of emission reductions 2018-2022 (SFS 2017:1201) 
 
Year  	2018  2019 2020 2021 2022  
Diesel  	19.3%  20%  21%  26% 30%
Petrol  	2.6%  2.6% 4.2%  6% 7.8%
 
The Government proposed in its Budget Bill for 2023 that the reduction levels within the reduction obligation scheme from 1 January 2024 are reduced to the EU minimal level.  As there are different interpretations of the EU mini-mum level, the reduction levels for the coming years are therefore uncertain."
Sweden,"A bonus malus system for the purchase of new light vehicles was implemented in 2018. Vehicles with low emissions of carbon dioxide qualified for a bonus at purchase, while vehicles with high emissions of carbon dioxide was taxed at a higher rate for the first three years. The system covered purchases of new light passenger cars, light buses and light trucks. The aim of the system was to increase the proportion of low-emission vehicles and contribute to achieving the goal of a fossil-free vehicle fleet. 
 
All cars were subject to at least SEK 360 per year in vehicle taxes regardless of emissions. Light petrol or diesel vehicles with high emissions of carbon dioxide were subject to an increase in vehicle tax (malus) during the first three years. Ethanol and gas-powered vehicles were exempted from the increased tax. When the cars reached three years, the extra tax disappeared and all but light diesel vehicles were taxed as in the differentiated vehicle tax system. 

A revision of the system, effective 1 June 2022, meant that vehicles with emissions exceeding 75 grams carbon dioxide per kilometer were subject to malus and that emissions exceeding 125 grams per kilometer were taxed at SEK 132 per gram. 

With effect from 8 November 2022 the Government discontinued the bonus malus system. This measure was still in effect when the projections of greenhouse gas emissions in Sweden were produced."
Sweden,"In order to achieve net zero emissions by 2045, and enable negative emissions thereafter, the Swedish Energy Agency was commissioned to be the national center for carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) and funds are also pro-vided to set up a system with reverse auctions for the capture and storage of carbon dioxide from renewable sources (bio-CCS). The possibility of includ-ing negative emissions with the help of biochar has also been analyzed. The grant is estimated to increase by SEK 50 million in 2022 and SEK 200 million in 2023. A budget frame of SEK 36 billion is allocated to bio-CCS for the period 2026ñ2046. The Swedish Energy Agency has been given the task of enabling the export of captured carbon dioxide from Swedish operations to storage sites in other countries."
Sweden,"The governmental initiative ëFossil Free Swedení, launched in 2015, aims to strengthen the dialogue between the state and the business sector, municipali-ties and civil society. A national coordinator, appointed by the government, is the link between the actors and the government in efforts to remove obstacles and create conditions to speed up the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Fossil Free Sweden is open to all actors who support the declaration drawn up for the initiative. The declaration stipulates that actors participating in the initi-ative share the view that the world must become fossil free. It also stipulates that actors who participate must be able to present concrete measures to re-duce emissions. So far, more than 450 actors have signed the declaration and 22 roadmaps from different sectors have been submitted to the government"
Sweden,"On 3 June 2021, the Swedish National Debt Office was given a mandate to issue state credit guarantees for large-scale green industrial investments in Sweden. The guarantees may cover new loans raised by companies with credit institutions for financing investments that contribute to reaching the goals of the Swedish environmental objectives system and climate policy framework.  The guarantee framework amounts to SEK 65 billion in 2023. The framework is estimated to SEK 80 billion in 2024. 
ï	To be eligible for a guarantee, a loan must amount to at least SEK 500 million.
ï	The guarantee covers up to 80 per cent of the loan.
ï	The maximum maturity of a guarantee is 15 years."
Sweden,"With the aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, individuals are, since 1 January 2021, eligible to a tax reduction for installation of green technolo-gy including grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system, systems for storage of self-produced electricity and home charging stations for electric vehicles.  The tax reduction is based on the cost of labor and equipment. For installation of solar-cell systems the tax reduction is 20%, and for installations of electricity-storage systems and home charging stations the reduction is 50%. The tax reduction cannot be more than SEK 50,000 per person and year."
Sweden,"The Government previously had a subsidy to property owners for renovation and energy efficiency measures that are taken on apartment buildings. On 1 December 2021 the Parliament decided to end this program, yet applications that were submitted by 31 December 2021 were to be accepted and grants were to be allocated to accommodate all support that was decided by 31 De-cember 2022. In the budget bill for 2023 the government proposed to allocate SEK 350 million for this purpose. The support should go to additional costs for energy efficiency measures. The aim of the subsidy is proposed to be to improve the profitability of energy efficiency measures."
Sweden,"In its Budget Bill for 2021 the Government proposes to introduce a reduction obligation for aviation to introduce renewable fuel. The level was initially 0.8% in 2021, set to increase to 27% in 2030. In 2023 the level was 2.6 %."
Sweden,The Government decided in its Budget Bill for 2021 on a support scheme for regional electrification pilots with charging infrastructure for heavy vehicles. The aim is to enable electrification of heavy road transport in the busiest are-as. Tank infrastructure for hydrogen is also included in the support scheme.  SEK 500 million was allocated for 2021 and the budget for the applications of 2022 was set to SEK 1543 million.
Sweden,In July 2020 the Government decided on a new support for public fast charg-ing infrastructure in connection with major roads in areas where fast charging is missing. The support aims at ensuring basic access to charging infrastructure for fast charging of electric vehicles throughout the country. The Swedish Transport Administration administrates the support totaling SEK 150 million during 2020-2022. The candidates can receive 100 percent investment support with a counter-requirement that the charging station must be in operation for five years
Sweden,"In 2018, the government launched an environmental compensation for freight transport by rail aimed at strengthening the competitive position of rail, there-by contributing to the transfer of goods from road to railway. The budget for 2018ñ2019 was SEK 563 million in total. In June 2020 the Govern-ment decided on another SEK 200 million SEK. Further, in December 2020, the Government decided to prolong and develop the compensation scheme and allocated SEK 400 million per year during 2021-2025. The yearly budget was subsequently raised to SEK 550 million. For 2022 specifically, the total funding amounts to SEK 1247 million."
Sweden,"Congestion tax is levied in the cities of Stockholm and Gothenborg since 2007 and 2013, respectively. The tax is levied during such hours and on such places where there is considered to be congestion. Various levels of tax are levied throughout the day (in Stockholm for 2023: SEK 15ñ45, in Gothenburg for 2023: SEK 9ñ22) with a maximum amount per day of SEK 135 in Stockholm and SEK 60 in Gothenburg"
Sweden,"The Government decided in December 2020 on a new support scheme for re-wetting previously drained wetlands, which aims at providing climate benefits while also strengthening biodiversity, balance water flows, increase the addition to ground water and reduce eutrophication. The rewetting of peatland is expected to halt the CO2 emissions caused by the drainage. The initiative is implemented primarily by raising funds within the local nature conservation initiative (LONA). The initiative is based on voluntary participation by land-owners. From 2023 the budget is increased by SEK 200 million annually, 2023-2025."
Sweden,"The government has decided on a reliability standard for Sweden that amounts to one (1) hour per year, based on the proposal by The Swedish Energy Market Inspectorate. Production and import of electricity must be able to cover the entire expected consumption need for electricity 99.989 percent of the time. The reliability standard describes how many hours per year it is economically justified that the country's production and possible imports do not satisfy the entire expected demand for electricity. The decision means that the Energy Market Inspectorate will be tasked with proposing an updated reliability standard in the next few years. The determination takes place in accordance with existing EU regulations and creates a good basis for continuously assessing resource adequacy in Sweden going forward."
Sweden,"Importers, sellers and consumers of oil are obliged by law to keep emergency stocks to ensure availability during severe supply crises for crude oil and oil products. The storage obligation is tied to Sweden's commitments to the IEA (International Energy Agency) according to the IEP agreement, an agreement between 29 countries on a joint energy program. The agreement requires, among other things, that each member state stores oil equivalent to 90 days of net imports. The size of the oil storage for supply crises is determined once a year by the Swedish Energy Agency, which determines who is responsible for storage and how extensive the individual storage must be. The size of the storage obligation is based on what the potential storage obligee has sold or consumed during the immediately preceding base year (calendar year). A storage year runs from 1 July to 30 June of the following year. The Swedish Energy Agency also monitors compliance with the legislation for emergency storage."
Sweden,"On June 27, 2022, the EU's energy ministers adopted the EU regulation on gas storage, which involves measures regarding the filling level in the EU's storage facilities. Well-filled gas stocks will contribute to a more secure gas supply initially during the winter of 2022ñ2023 but will be continued. The regulation involves, among other things, a mandatory minimum level of gas in storage facilities on the territory of the member states. In order to increase security of supply, according to the new regulation, underground gas storage must be filled to at least 80 percent of capacity before the coming winter and to 90 percent before subsequent winter periods."
Sweden,"The Swedish Energy Market Inspectorate (Ei) has published new measurement regulations. The main changes compared to previous metering regulations concern the transition from 60-minute settlement to 15-minute settlement. The measuring regulations have also been supplemented with functional requirements for measuring systems and measuring equipment, which was previously regulated in a separate regulation. During the development of the new measurement regulations, there were thoughts about clarifying the possibility that customers have to influence the settlement and measurement method. However, Ei has chosen not to enter such a thing in the regulation. According to the impact assessment that is part of the regulation, Ei instead intends to test electricity users' ability to influence the measurement method and settlement method."
Sweden,"The purpose of the directive is to establish a common framework for promoting energy efficiency within the EU. The initial goal was 20 percent primary energy savings in 2020. The Directive contains provisions aimed at removing barriers and overcoming some of the market failures that hinder efficiency in the supply and use of energy. It also consists of measures within all parts of the energy system - from energy conversion via transmission and distribution to final use, but not in the transport system. The directive requires, among other things, that: Energy requirements must be included in certain public procurement, Energy-efficient renovations must be carried out in some government buildings, There must be a strategy for energy-efficient renovations for the building stock in the country, Large companies must do an energy survey, Small and medium-sized companies must receive support to carry out an energy survey, Consumers must receive information about energy efficiency, Consumers must have free access to information on their energy invoice, Potential for the use of district heating/district cooling, as well as residual heat must be mapped, There must be information about and availability of energy services."
Sweden,"The recast EPBD aims to accelerate building renovation rates, reduce GHG emissions and energy consumption, and promote the uptake of renewable energy in buildings. It would introduce a new EU definition of a ëzero emissions buildingí, applicable to all new buildings from 2027 and to all renovated buildings from 2030. Zero-emissions buildings would need to factor in their life-cycle global warming potential. The recast EPBD would accelerate energy-efficient renovations in the worst performing 15 % of EU buildings, and would set minimum energy performance standards. In due course, every building would need to achieve at least a Class E on a revised A-G scale of energy performance certificates (EPCs). EPCs would be included in linked national databases. The file has been referred to the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), which will in due course appoint a rapporteur, who will produce a draft report. First edition. The 'EU Legislation in Progress' briefings are updated at key stages throughout the legislative procedure.
The meaning of a near-zero energy building was changed from 1 September 2020 so that it also appears that the energy supplied must come to a very high degree from renewable energy sources. At the same time, weighting factors were introduced to contribute to technology neutrality between sustainable heating systems that are not fossil fuel-based."
Sweden,"Requirement that certain buildings from 2025 be equipped with a system for property automation and property control, i.e. smart systems that, among other things, can detect efficiency losses and inform about opportunities for improved energy efficiency in the property. In some cases, the requirements also apply to existing buildings."
Sweden,"Requirements are introduced that if in a building there is a heating system or a combined space heating and ventilation system with a nominal effect on space heating of more than 70 kilowatts, or an air conditioning system or a combined air conditioning and ventilation system with a nominal effect of more than 70 kilowatts, then the heating or cooling system must be regularly inspected. The inspection provisions came into force on 10 March 2020."
Sweden,"In this bill, the government specifies guidelines for the continued efforts regarding research, development, demonstration and commercialization in the energy field. Furthermore, overall goals are proposed for the efforts for research and innovation in the energy field. Efforts for research and innovation in the energy field must be directed so that they can contribute to the fulfillment of set energy and climate goals, the long-term energy and climate policy and energy-related environmental policy goals. The goals of the Energy Research Bill 2012."
Sweden,The purpose of the support is to increase the production of manure-based biogas. The fertilizer gas subsidy is a project that started in 2014 and ends in 2023.
Sweden,The carbon tax was increased on 1 August 2019 for fuels consumed in certain facilities covered by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The increases refer to fuels that are consumed in cogeneration plants as well as to fuels that are consumed in other heat production within the trading system than that which takes place in the manufacturing process in industrial operations or in cogeneration production. The increase is proposed to be removed on 1 January 2024. This PaM connects to PaM no 9.
Sweden,"The investment support for energy storage was introduced in 2016 and is intended for the storage of self-produced electricity, in practice solar electricity. The change meant an extension of the possibility to grant grants for measures that are completed in 2020. The extension meant that grants according to the regulation can be granted for the same length of time as the support according to the regulation (2009:689) on state aid to solar cells. This support has been replaced by PaM No. 76, Tax deduction for green investments, from 1 January 2021."
Sweden,"Information campaign to reduce energy use in villas, terraced houses, semi-detached houses or privately owned vacation homes."
Sweden,"Consumption-reducing information campaign. Swedish Energy Agency is carrying out an information campaign to contribute to changed habits and increased knowledge to reduce electricity use. Due to the energy situation in Sweden and Europe is severely strained. For example the price levels for electricity are high and may rise even more. There is also a risk that the electricity will not be enough for certain hours this winter. Together, we can improve the situation by reducing electricity use, for example by lowering the heat indoors, using less hot water and using electricity at the right time of day"
Sweden,Information campaign with advice on measures to reduce the use of electricity in government agencies through energy efficiency to reduce the risks of disturbances in the electricity system during the winter.

Ce plan a ÈtÈ ÈlaborÈ par le DÈpartement de líamÈnagement du MinistËre de lí…nergie et de líAmÈnagement du territoire, en collaboration Ètroite avec le MinistËre de lí…conomie (en tant quíautoritÈ de gestion du FEDER) et le MinistËre du Travail, de l'Emploi et de l'…conomie sociale et solidaire (en tant quíautoritÈ de gestion du FSE+), et a ÈtÈ approuvÈ par la Commission europÈenne en dÈcembre 2022. Afin de faire face aux dÈfis de la transition dans les 11 communes de la rÈgion Sud, le PTTJ vise, premiËrement, ‡ attÈnuer les co˚ts de la modernisation des secteurs en transformation, ‡ lutter contre la prÈcaritÈ ÈnergÈtique et ‡ faciliter la mobilitÈ locale durable, et, deuxiËmement, ‡ soutenir les travailleurs touchÈs par la transition ‡ travers la formation."
Luxembourg,"Depuis 2021, les carburants et combustibles fossiles sont soumis ‡ la taxe CO2. Les plafonds des taux de la taxe CO2 sont fixÈs par la loi modifiÈe du 17 dÈcembre 2010 fixant les droits díaccise et les taxes assimilÈes sur les produits ÈnergÈtiques, líÈlectricitÈ, les produits de tabacs manufacturÈs, líalcool et les boissons alcooliques. Les taux annuels de la taxe CO2 sont arrÍtÈs par voie de rËglement grand-ducal et correspondaient ‡ 20 Ä/t CO2 en 2021 et 25 Ä/t CO2 en 2022. A partir du 1er janvier 2023, le taux Èquivaut ‡ 30 Ä/t CO2. Les recettes gÈnÈrÈes par la taxe CO2 sont utilisÈes de faÁon Èquitable pour financer des mesures climatiques et de transition ÈnergÈtique et des mesures de compensation sociales en faveur des mÈnages ‡ faible revenu, comme le crÈdit d'impÙt destinÈ aux deux quintiles infÈrieurs de revenus (Q1 et Q2) ainsi que l'augmentation de l'allocation de vie chËre. Les activitÈs couvertes par le systËme díÈchange de quotas díÈmission de gaz ‡ effet de serre de l'UE sont exonÈrÈes de la taxe.
Au vu des objectifs climatiques nationaux et sectoriels instaurÈs par la loi relative au climat, le prix du carbone continuera ‡ Ítre majorÈ annuellement de 5 Ä/t CO2 pour atteindre en 2026 un niveau de 45 Ä/t CO2, ce qui correspond au niveau de prix visÈ par le futur systËme d'Èchange de quotas d'Èmission de l'UE pour les b‚timents, le transport routier et les combustibles dans certains secteurs industriels, qui sera introduit en 2027. Comme les projections du STATEC montrent ‡ ce stade que des augmentations annuelles de 5 Ä/t CO2 resteront nÈcessaires pour respecter les budgets díÈmission cumulÈs pour la pÈriode 2021-2030 dont dispose le Luxembourg, il est prÈvu que les dispositions relatives ‡ líÈvolution de la taxe CO2 pour la pÈriode 2027-2030 soient rÈÈvaluÈes en 2026. Ces Èvolutions de la taxe CO2 sont ‡ considÈrer ´ on top ª díÈventuelles mesures des Etats riverains, notamment ‡ la suite de líintroduction du SEQE-2, qui pourraient le cas ÈchÈant influencer ‡ nouveau le diffÈrentiel de prix des carburants routiers entre le Luxembourg et les rÈgions voisines. Une augmentation de la taxe CO2 de 5 Ä correspond ‡ une augmentation du prix des carburants routiers de 1,1 ‡ 1,2 centimes par litre.
Les Etats membres pourront exempter les entitÈs visÈes par líextension du systËme díÈchange de quotas d'Èmission sous condition quíelles soient soumises ‡ une taxe carbone au niveau national dont le niveau est Ègal ou supÈrieur au prix dans le nouveau systËme d'Èchange de quotas d'Èmission de l'UE.
Le gouvernement Ètudiera en dÈtail quel systËme sera le plus avantageux en terme de l'action climat et d'impacts sociaux. Par la suite, une dÈcision sera prise par rapport au maintien ou non, au-del‡ de 2026, du systËme de la taxe CO2 nationale. Le systËme actuel prÈsente l'avantage manifeste que la moitiÈ des revenus de la taxe CO2 est dÈdiÈe ‡ des mesures sociales d'attÈnuation destinÈes aux mÈnages les plus vulnÈrables. Le comitÈ interministÈriel pour l'action climat suivra de prËs la mise en úuvre de la taxe CO2, dont en particulier líefficacitÈ de la taxe par rapport aux objectifs sectoriels. Il fera un rapport trimestriel au Conseil de gouvernement.
Le gouvernement maintient que les recettes gÈnÈrÈes par la taxe CO2 continueront díÍtre affectÈes pour moitiÈ ‡ des mesures de protection du climat et de transition ÈnergÈtique et pour líautre moitiÈ ‡ des mesures de compensation sociale pour les mÈnages ‡ revenus modestes, dont une augmentation de l'allocation de vie chËre et un crÈdit díimpÙt intitulÈ ´ crÈdit díimpÙt climat ª. Pour líannÈe 2023, le taux de la taxe Èquivaut ‡ 30 Ä/t CO2 avec un crÈdit díimpÙt correspondant de 144 Ä. AprËs 2023, le montant du ´ crÈdit díimpÙt climat ª sera fixÈ chaque annÈe de maniËre visible pour le citoyen ‡ travers la loi concernant l'impÙt sur le revenu et reflÈtera líÈvolution de la taxe CO2."
Luxembourg,"En vue de montrer le bon exemple dans la lutte contre le dÈrËglement clima-tique, une stratÈgie de dÈcarbonation de l'administration Ètatique sera Èlabo-rÈe en coopÈration avec tous les acteurs concernÈs. La stratÈgie visera l'objec-tif de la neutralitÈ climatique de l'administration Ètatique dËs 2040 et couvrira notamment le parc immobilier, le parc automobile et les marchÈs publics en gÈnÈral de líEtat et des Ètablissements publics. Elle abordera l'organisation et les moyens nÈcessaires ‡ sa mise en oeuvre et comprendra un calendrier indi-catif. Une communication rÈguliËre sera organisÈe autour de l'implÈmentation de la stratÈgie et de la rÈalisation de projets phares. 
Le Pacte Climat avec les communes incitera les administrations communales ‡ poursuivre des efforts similaires."
Luxembourg,"Parmi les objectifs politiques du projet de PDAT2023, les deux premiers ont un impact majeur sur la rÈduction des Èmissions de CO2 : la rÈduction progressive de l'artificialisation du sol et la concentration du dÈveloppement aux endroits les plus appropriÈs. Le premier objectif vise la rÈduction de l'artificialisation du sol pour tendre vers zÈro en 2050, justement pour prÈserver les terres agricoles et forestiËres entre autre pour leur capacitÈs d'absorption de CO2. CombinÈ ‡ un dÈveloppement multifonctionnel tout en prÈservant et en dÈvelop-pant le maillage vert intraurbain, la concentration du dÈveloppement permet une importante rÈduction des besoins en dÈplacement motorisÈs et une augmentation de la qualitÈ de vie. En outre, cette approche limite le dÈveloppe-ment urbain diffus, co˚teux et nÈfaste pour la qualitÈ paysagËre. Finalement, une planification infrastructurelle anticipative est possible Ètant donnÈ que l'on connait les endroits ou les dÈveloppement urbain sera rÈalisÈ."
Luxembourg,"Le concept de la ´ Ville du quart díheure ª, qui vise ‡ mettre ‡ disposition les services essentiels nÈcessaires ‡ la vie ‡ une distance díun quart díheure ‡ pied ou ‡ vÈlo du lieu de rÈsidence, est actuellement en train díÍtre appliquÈ dans de grandes mÈtropoles telles que Paris, Copenhague, Milan ou encore Dublin. 
Le projet de PDAT2023 prÈvoit la dÈclinaision de ce concept dans les trois grandes agglomÈrations luxembourgeoises, la Nordstad, líAgglo-Centre et la RÈgion Sud. En effet dans le cadre de la pandÈmie Covid, líimportance de la proximitÈ de tels services a encore ÈtÈ accentuÈe et il síavËre donc nÈcessaire de planifier les villes en tenant compte de la proximitÈ et de líaccessibilitÈ des services.

Luxembourg,"OrganisÈe entre septembre 2020 et fÈvrier 2022, la Consultation internationale ""Luxembourg in Transition"" Ètait un processus qui rÈunissait plusieurs Èquipes internationales composÈes de spÈcialistes en la matiËre pour dÈvelopper des projets qui pemettaient de rÈaliser la transition Ècologique du territoire fonc-tionnel luxembourgeois ‡ l'horizon 2050. VÈritable laboratoire d'idÈes ""out of the box"", la consultation a permis un foisonnement d'idÈes censÈes inspirer les politiques sectorielles mais aussi sensibiliser les citoyens d'adapter leurs com-portements. Parmi les idÈes produites, deux idÈes sont dÈj‡ en train d'Ítre implÈmentÈes : ""Ceinture verte autour de l'agglomÈration de Luxembourg-Ville"" et la ""Zone verte interurbaine"". Le premier vise ‡ dÈvelopper une cein-ture verte, naturelle et agroalimentaire autour de la capitale servant ainsi plu-sieurs objectifs dont notamment la rÈcrÈation, le dÈveloppement des infras-tructures vertes et la promotion de la consommation locale. Le deuxiËme pro-jet se concentre sur l'espace entre les agglomÈrations de Luxembourg-Ville et de la RÈgion Sud et vise la prÈservation des qualitÈs paysagËres de ces espaces tout en favorisant le dÈveloppement de l'agroalimentaire. Les deux projets sont Ègalement inscrits dans le projet de PDAT2023 en raison de leur concor-dance avec les deux premiers objectifs politiques."
Luxembourg,"La transition ÈnergÈtique et climatique repose en grande partie sur des mesures technologiques. Dans ce contexte la disponibilitÈ d'une main d'úuvre qualifiÈe est essentielle et reprÈsente actuellement líun des plus grands dÈfis ‡ relever pour la mise ‡ disposition des moyens nÈcessaires pour atteindre les objectifs climatiques.
L'orientation vers la formation professionnelle se fait ‡ la fin de la classe de 5e (3e annÈe de líenseignement secondaire gÈnÈral) sur avis du conseil de classe, en fonction des rÈsultats scolaires et des intÈrÍts de l'ÈlËve. Il existe trois voies de formation menant aux certifications suivantes : le certificat de capacitÈ professionnelle (CCP), le diplÙme díaptitude professionnelle (DAP) et le diplÙme de technicien (DT).
Afin de garantir une adÈquation entre les programmes scolaires, les contenus des cours et les dÈfis en lien avec avec les compÈtences requises dans le cadre de la transition ÈnergÈtique et climatique, les programmes sont dÈveloppÈs et mis ‡ jour par les Èquipes curriculaires, en partenariat avec les reprÈsentants des chambres professionnelles, la chambre des salariÈs, et des reprÈsentants sectoriels des entreprises formatrices. LíÈvaluation systÈmatique et rÈguliËre des programmes en concertation avec les reprÈsentants des chambres professionnelles dans le cadre du Groupe de pilotage ‡ la formation professionnelle permet ‡ dÈfinir les besoins de mise ‡ jour et les objectifs stratÈgiques. Dans ce cadre, líexpression de la demande de compÈtences pour la transition ÈnergÈtique et climatique a menÈ ‡ líintroduction ‡ court terme de nouveaux programmes (DT Smart Technologies dont les spÈcialisations ´ Smart Buildings and Energies ª, ´Smart Energy ª ´ …nergies Renouvelables ª) ainsi que líintroduction de certifications supplÈmentaires dans le cadre des diplÙmes de la formation initiale, p.ex. manipulation des unitÈs de rÈfrigÈration contenant des gaz ‡ effet de serre fluorÈs (´ K‰lteschein ª).. 
Il est aussi impÈratif de continuer ‡ investir dans líoffre de reconversion professionnelle pour offrir aux demandeurs d'emploi sans qualification reconnue de nouvelles chances et perspectives.
Au-del‡ de ces initiatives publiques, il síavËre aussi opportun de chercher, voire de renforcer des partenariats avec des initiatives privÈes respectivement provenant de la sociÈtÈ civile, afin de promouvoir le dÈveloppement díune offre de formation large et diversifiÈe.
En outre, il síavËre opportun de lancer une initiative nationale pour valoriser davantage les emplois artisanaux pour les mÈtiers liÈs aux objectifs du PNEC. Dans ce cadre, les chambres professionnelles, les fÈdÈrations díartisans et les ministËres concernÈs se rÈunissent pour Èlaborer ensemble un programme qui, d'une part, souligne l'importance stratÈgique de l'artisanat et, d'autre part, vise ‡ inciter les ÈlËves ‡ opter activement pour une formation artisanale dans les domaines de la transition ÈnergÈtique et climatique."
Luxembourg,"Klima-Agence soutient tous les acteurs de la sociÈtÈ dans leur engagement pour la protection du climat et la transition ÈnergÈtique.

Dans ce cadre, il est notamment prÈvu de faire Èvaluer la dÈmarche de communication de Klima-Agence en produisant notamment davantage díÈmissions courtes et rÈguliËres ‡ la tÈlÈvision ou ‡ la radio pour toucher le plus grand nombre de spectateurs. Ces spots pourraient aussi Ítre utilisÈs sur les rÈseaux sociaux sous forme de petits clips condensÈs ou díinfographies.
En outre, Klima-Agence va communiquer plus clairement sur les compÈtences des divers Ètablissements publics et administrations afin de faciliter líaccËs aux informations sur les diffÈrents rËglements et lois en vigueur ainsi que les divers subsides en place.
Dans le cadre du Pacte Climat 2.0, Klima-Agence et ses partenaires mobilisent Ègalement les communes pour quíelles sensibilisent et incitent leurs concitoyens ‡ rÈflÈchir plus sur leur style de vie et quíelles recourent plus ‡ des modËles díinitiatives citoyennes comme líÈconomie de partage, les communautÈs ÈnergÈtiques, les jardins communautaires, etc. Dans ce cadre, les communes seront incitÈes ‡ organiser des sÈminaires / ateliers d'information avec leurs partenaires, pour promouvoir et faciliter un mode de vie durable.

La thÈmatique du NCER sera ciblÈe sur la digitalisation et la mise en place díun ´ digital twin ª au niveau national pour accÈlÈrer la transition Èner-gÈtique. Les projets NCER sont financÈs par le FNR sur base d'une Èvaluation indÈpendante internationale pour une pÈriode maximale de huit ans et reprÈ-sentent donc des investissements ‡ long terme dans le cadre des prioritÈs na-tionales de recherche. Le montant maximal du financement d'un NCER est de 15 millions d'euros sur 5-8 ans. S'y ajoutent des contributions propres variables en provenance des institutions de recherche. Le NCER promeut la recherche transdisciplinaire et la collaboration Ètroite avec des acteurs publics et privÈs.

Luxembourg,"Finances climatiques et durables
De 2021 ‡ 2025, un montant total de 220 millions díeuros est mis ‡ disposition pour le financement climatique international, qui vise une rÈpartition ÈquilibrÈe entre líattÈnuation du changement climatique, líadaptation et la rÈsilience, ainsi que rÈcemment les pertes et dommages (´ loss and damage ª). ConformÈment ‡ la loi du 15 dÈcembre 2020 relative au climat ce montant de 220 millions díeuros prÈvoit la possibilitÈ de financer des projets climatiques nationaux dans le domaine de la finance durable ‡ travers des mÈcanismes et instruments innovants. 
Le financement mixte (´ blended finance ª) 
En mobilisant des fonds publics pour rÈduire le risque des investissements privÈs, le financement mixte peut contribuer ‡ catalyser des capitaux supplÈmentaires en faveur des solutions climatiques. Le Luxembourg agit dÈj‡ en tant que catalyseur pour stimuler líinvestissement durable, notamment avec le le ´ Klimapakt fir Betriber ª,  lí´International Climate Finance Accelerator ª, et la ´ Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform ª. Le Luxembourg Ètudiera la possibilitÈ d'Èlargir son offre de financement mixte. Un potentiel important de financement dans le domaine de la banque de dÈtail existe et pourrait Ítre envisagÈ ‡ l'avenir.

Les hypothËques vertes (´ Green mortgages ª)
Pour inciter un emprunteur ‡ acheter un b‚timent vert ou ‡ rÈnover un b‚timent existant pour le rendre plus vert, une banque peut proposer soit un taux d'intÈrÍt plus bas, soit un montant de prÍt plus ÈlevÈ (hypothËque verte). Le gouvernement luxembourgeois Ètudiera les moyens de rÈduire les obstacles techniques et sociaux aux hypothËques vertes, notamment en proposant aux institutions financiËres des recommandations basÈes sur les classes ÈnergÈtiques des b‚timents (dans le respect du rËglement gÈnÈral sur la protection des donnÈes (RGPD)). 

La budgÈtisation verte (´ Green Budgeting ª) 
La budgÈtisation verte consiste ‡ intÈgrer des considÈrations de durabilitÈ dans le processus budgÈtaire national et peut Ítre un outil puissant pour financer la transition vers une Èconomie plus durable. Le Luxembourg a dÈj‡ pris des mesures pour intÈgrer les principes de budgÈtisation verte dans ses pratiques de gestion des finances publiques, notamment en ce qui concerne les dÈpenses du PNEC. Le Luxembourg continue ‡ Ètudier comment les pratiques de budgÈtisation verte peuvent Ítre ÈlaborÈes davantage entre autres par le biais du budget ordinaire, des fonds spÈciaux et des marchÈs publics. A titre díexemple, le gouvernement luxembourgeois a Èmis une premiËre obligation souveraine durable en 2020 pour un montant dí1,5 milliards díeuros afin de financer et refinancer au moins 65 investissements durables. Ce faisant, le Luxembourg a ÈtÈ le premier pays europÈen et le premier pays du monde notÈ AAA ‡ Èmettre une obligation souveraine durable.

La sensibilisation au financement climatique du secteur financier
La sensibilisation du secteur financier luxembourgeois au financement climatique est une composante essentielle pour atteindre les objectifs climatiques. De ce fait, la ´ Luxembourg Sustainable Finance Initiative ª (LSFI) a ÈtÈ crÈÈe en 2020 avec un de ses buts la sensibilisation, la promotion et líaide au dÈveloppement des initiatives de finance durable au Luxembourg. Dans la mÍme optique, un partenariat stratÈgique avec líUniversitÈ du Luxembourg a ÈtÈ conclu en 2020 afin de crÈer un projet de recherche en finance durable, dont un programme de Master qui a pour objectif de former des talents dans le domaine de la finance climatique et durable. Le gouvernement continuera de soutenir la sensibilisation du secteur financier."
Luxembourg,"Des projets de transition ÈnergÈtique et climatique au niveau local sont impor-tants pour initier des modes de production et de consommation ainsi que de nouvelles solutions compatibles avec la protection du climat. 
Cependant, l'un des plus grands dÈfis de la transition verte est le passage ‡ líÈchelle de ces initiatives, projets-pilote et bonnes pratiques, tout en intÈgrant les aspects environnementaux, socio-Èconomiques et de bonne gestion (´ upscaling ª). 
Pour faciliter cela, une coalition d'acteurs publics, privÈs et de la sociÈtÈ civile est nÈcessaire.
L'objectif fondamental est de stimuler et d'optimiser les projets ‡ caractËre dÈmonstratif qui contribuent ‡ un cadre exemplaire pour le dÈveloppement de concepts et de lignes directrices, afin de faciliter un dÈploiement plus large d'approches innovantes et transformatrices au Luxembourg et dans la rÈgion."
Luxembourg,"Un cadre lÈgislatif a ÈtÈ mis en place en 2015 pour crÈer un mÈcanisme d'obligations pour les fournisseurs díÈlectricitÈ et de gaz naturel (les parties obligÈes) afin de les inciter ‡ gÈnÈrer des Èconomies d'Ènergie auprËs des consommateurs au Luxembourg. Ce mÈcanisme, basÈ sur l'article 7 de la directive europÈenne 2012/27/UE relative ‡ l'efficacitÈ ÈnergÈtique, oblige certains acteurs ‡ mettre ‡ profit de l'efficacitÈ ÈnergÈtique et in fine des consommateurs, leur connaissance du marchÈ et leur expertise dans le domaine de l'Ènergie.
La premiËre pÈriode du mÈcanisme d'obligation couvre les annÈes de 2015 ‡ 2020, pour un objectif global cumulÈ exprimÈ en termes de consommation díÈnergie finale de 5.993 GWh Èquivalent ‡ une nouvelle Èconomie annuelle moyenne de 285 GWh.
Líobjet de ce mÈcanisme est díinitier et de promouvoir des projets d'Èconomies d'Ènergie par les parties obligÈes, notamment par le biais d'incitatifs financiers ou non-financiers pour des investissements dans l'efficacitÈ ÈnergÈtique du secteur industriel, des b‚timents et des transports. ¿ cette fin, tous les consommateurs, ‡ savoir les entreprises, les communes et les particuliers sont ciblÈs. Le mÈcanisme est mis ‡ jour rÈguliËrement, notamment sur base des rÈvisions de la directive europÈenne relative ‡ líefficacitÈ ÈnergÈtique."
Luxembourg,"Le mÈcanisme d'obligations en matiËre d'efficacitÈ ÈnergÈtique, mis en place en 2015 pour une premiËre pÈriode couvrant les annÈes 2015 ‡ 2020, est rÈvisÈ en 2021 pour la deuxiËme pÈriode couvrant les annÈes 2021 ‡ 2030. Les fournisseurs d'ÈlectricitÈ et de gaz naturel sont toujours les parties obligÈes dans ce mÈcanisme.
Afin de faciliter le respect des obligations aux ""petits"" fournisseurs, la rÈvision introduit une option de rachat (""buy-out"") permettant aux parties obligÈes de s'acquitter díune partie (jusqu'‡ concurrence de 1.500 MWh par annÈe au maximum) de leurs obligations annuelles díÈconomies díÈnergie par le paie-ment díun montant Èquivalent aux investissements requis pour remplir les-dites obligations.
La rÈvision de 2021 renforce Ègalement l'obligation par l'introduction d'une pÈnalitÈ nettement plus dissuasive que l'amende d'ordre prÈvue dans le mÈ-canisme pour la premiËre pÈriode. Les parties obligÈes qui níauront pas rÈalisÈ leurs volumes annuels díÈconomies díÈnergie seront contraintes ‡ payer une pÈnalitÈ (libÈratoire) prononcÈe par le rÈgulateur.
Le niveau d'ambition (nouvelles Èconomies d'Ènergie ‡ rÈaliser chaque annÈe par les parties obligÈes) a ÈtÈ maintenu au niveau (moyen) sur la premiËre pÈriode. L'objectif global cumulÈ exprimÈ en termes de consommation díÈnergie finale pour la pÈriode de 2021 ‡ 2030 est de 13.750 GWh Èquivalent ‡ une nouvelle Èconomie annuelle moyenne de 250 GWh."
Luxembourg,"Líobjectif principal de cette mesure est la crÈation díun cadre favorable pour le dÈploiement continu des Ènergies renouvelables en vue des objectifs repris dans la directive 2018/2001 via diffÈrents instruments díaides au fonctionne-ment, afin díaugmenter la part des sources d'Ènergie renouvelables dans le secteur de l'ÈlectricitÈ et de la chaleur en vue de la dÈcarbonation du systËme ÈnergÈtique. Le cadre rÈglementaire est le rËglement grand-ducal modifiÈ du 1er ao˚t 2014 relatif ‡ la production d'ÈlectricitÈ basÈe sur les sources d'Ènergie renouvelables qui dÈtermine e.a. le raccordement au rÈseau Èlectrique et la fourniture d'ÈlectricitÈ, le systËme des garanties d'origine et les rÈmunÈrations garanties sous forme de tarifs d'injection ou primes de marchÈ pour líÈlectricitÈ produite ‡ partir d'Ènergie Èolienne, solaire ou hydroÈlectrique,de biogaz, gaz de stations díÈpuration díeaux usÈes, biomasse solide et bois de rebut. Les niveaux des rÈmunÈrations varient en fonction de la source d'Ènergie renouve-lable et de la puissance Èlectrique de l'installation.

En complÈment, des primes de chaleur pour la chaleur commerciali-sÈe cogÈnÈrÈe et une prime de lisier, qui sera rÈfomÈe via la stratÈgie biogaz en mettant líaccent sur les effluents díÈlevage (mesure 215), sont prÈvues.  Le rËglement prÈvoit Ègalement la tenue díappels díoffres pour les installations photovoltaÔques de grande envergure (mesure 205). Les derniËres adaptations importantes du rËglement ont ÈtÈ :
a) LíÈlargissement du cercle des bÈnÈfi-ciaires des tarifs pour centrales photovoltaÔques díune puissance comprise entre 30 et 200 kW ‡ toutes les personnes physiques et morales (avant seule-ment sociÈtÈs coopÈratives et civiles ; en 2020) ;
b) Adaptation des tarifs pour grandes centrales ‡ biomasse et bois de rebut ‡ cause des Èvolutions de mar-chÈ (2022) ;
c) Pour 2023 : suspension de la dÈgression des rÈmunÈrations ‡ cause de la flambÈe des prix (2022) ;
d) Augmentation prÈvue en 2023 des tarifs pour centrales biogaz pour redynamiser la filiËre.

Au cas o˘ líapproche volontaire síavÈrait insuffisante, voire trop lente, il est envisagÈ d'autoriser le remplacement d'installations de chauffage dans le patrimoine existant (pour tous types de b‚timents, aussi bien fonctionnels que d'habitation) exclusivement avec des installations de chauffage qui sont opÈrÈes avec un minimum de 70% díÈnergies renouvelables, c.-‡-d. pour lesquelles au moins 70% de la demande de chaleur utile sur líannÈe sont couverts par de líÈnergie renouvelable (systËmes hybrides autorisÈs).
Afin de donner une visibilitÈ sur l'Èvolution des exigences, ce phase-out sera, le cas ÈchÈant, annoncÈ ‡ l'avance par une lÈgislation/rÈglementation avec une phase transitoire et des dates de prise d'effet 
prÈcises pour les chaudiËres au fioul (mazout) et les chaudiËres au gaz naturel.
Le ´ phase-out fossile ª níest pas une obligation de remplacer une installation de chauffage (fossile) qui est encore en Ètat de fonctionnement correct ; le phase-out síapplique au moment du remplacement díune chaudiËre existante qui est soit hors service ou qui níest plus autorisÈe ‡ fonctionner sur base de la rÈglementation en vigueur.
Les rÈgimes díaides consÈquents actuels resteront en place aprËs le dÈbut du phase-out obligatoire, notamment les aides pour le remplacement d'une installation de chauffage par une installation fonctionnant avec des Ènergies renouvelables, dans le but de compenser une partie des surco˚ts Èventuels par rapport ‡ un remplacement par une chaudiËre fossile, tels le rÈgime díaides Ètatiques ´ Klimabonus ª (avec notamment le bonus ´ Masuttersatzprogramm ª augmentant les aides allouÈes dans le cas du remplacement díune chaudiËre alimentÈe au combustible fossile existante et, le cas ÈchÈant, le ´ top-up social ª sur les aides Klimabonus) , ainsi que, le cas ÈchÈant, les aides proposÈes par les communes et certains acteurs privÈs, tels que les parties obligÈes (fournisseurs díÈlectricitÈ et de gaz naturel) dans le cadre du mÈcanisme díobligations en matiËre díefficacitÈ ÈnergÈtique (EEOS).
Exceptionnellement, il peut Ítre dÈrogÈ ‡ une obligation de rÈnovation ÈnergÈtique díun b‚timent ou interdiction de remplacement díune chaudiËre fossile par une nouvelle chaudiËre ‡ base díÈnergie fossile dÈcoulant d'une mesure du PNEC, lorsque les co˚ts affÈrents liÈs ‡ la complexitÈ des travaux, nÈcessaires ‡ sa mise en úuvre, sont disproportionnÈs par rapport au potentiel de rÈduction des Èmissions de CO2. Ces exceptions seront spÈcifiÈes dans les lÈgislations affÈrentes aux obligations et interdictions.
Des solutions díaccompagnement (financier et/ou technique) complÈmentaires seront analysÈes et communiquÈes avec la future rÈglementation sur ce ´ phase-out fossile ª, afin de couvrir les cas extrÍmes prÈsentant des difficultÈs de rÈalisation technique ou des difficultÈs liÈes au financement des solutions alternatives aux solutions fossiles. 
Il est envisagÈ de rendre obligatoire la mise en place d'un stock d'installations de chauffage ""de dÈpannage"" pouvant servir, le cas ÈchÈant, de solution intermÈdiaire/transitoire (quelques semaines ‡ quelques mois) en cas de dÈfaillance imprÈvue sur une chaudiËre (fossile) existante. L'installation de dÈpannage permettra de couvrir le temps nÈcessaire pour le dimensionnement, choix, commande et installation d'une nouvelle installation de chauffage rÈpondant aux exigences du ""phase-out fossile"". Les installations de chauffage de dÈpannage pourront Ítre des installations ‡ Ènergie fossile (gaz naturel ou fioul de chauffage, en fonction de la chaudiËre existante dÈfaillante (disponibilitÈ du combustible en question)), des chauffages Èlectriques, des pompes ‡ chaleur ou des systËmes combinÈs."
Luxembourg,"Afin de simplifier et accÈlÈrer l'accËs aux aides Ètatiques dans le cadre du rÈ-gime ""Klimabonus"", la simplification et la digitalisation des formulaires de de-mande ainsi que des procÈdures dans le cadre d'une demande d'aide sont une prioritÈ.
Cette digitalisation est une nÈcessitÈ pour faciliter et accÈlÈrer l'accËs aux aides et s'inscrit dans les efforts de l'Etat de la simplification administrative et de la digitalisation des processus."

Afin de garantir une adÈquation des programmes de formation pour les diffÈrents niveaux de compÈtences et domaines concernÈs, avec les dÈfis relatifs aux objectifs du PNEC, une Èvaluation systÈmatique et rÈguliËre de ces programmes en concertation avec les acteurs du terrain et le(s) ministËre(s) concernÈ(s), sous forme díune initiative nationale regroupant tous les acteurs concernÈs, est nÈcessaire.
Pour complÈter cette offre de formation, il est aussi nÈcessaire de continuer ‡ investir dans les offres de reconversion professionnelle (re-skilling) pour offrir aux demandeurs d'emploi des perspectives dans díautres branches. ¿ titre d'exemple, on peut Èvoquer le secteur des installateurs et chauffagistes qui s'efforcent de plus en plus d'abandonner les systËmes de chauffage ‡ Ènergie fossile au profit de systËmes modernes tels que les pompes ‡ chaleur.
Afin de faciliter líaccËs ‡ la formation continue au niveau des entreprises, la possibilitÈ des aides financiËres et des incitations pour des formations en lien avec la transition ÈnergÈtique, comme p.ex. des ´ skills bridges ª pour le personnel du secteur de la construction, sera analysÈe."

La proposition de refonte de la directive europÈenne concernant la performance ÈnergÈtique des b‚timents (EPBD - Energy Performance of Buildings Directive) prÈvoit des objectifs de rÈnovation ÈnergÈtique progressive des b‚timents. Les objectifs se basent sur des standards de performance ÈnergÈtiques minimums (MEPS - Minimum Energy Performance Standards) ‡ atteindre par type de b‚timent et selon un ÈchÈancier spÈcifique. Les premiers b‚timents visÈs dans un premier temps sont les b‚timents les moins performants.

Cette mesure figure parmi les mesures structurelles identifiÈes au niveau de la stratÈgie de rÈnovation ‡ long terme.
Líobjectif principal consiste dans líassistance structurÈe et complËte des propriÈtaires de b‚timents rÈsidentiels ‡ faible performance ÈnergÈtique, au niveau de líidentification des potentiels d'amÈlioration, de la planification, du financement (prenant en compte tous les mÈcanismes d'aides existants) et de la rÈalisation des mesures de rÈnovation ÈnergÈtique, de dÈcarbonation et de mise en oeuvre d'installations photovoltaÔques. L'initiative cible tous les propriÈtaires de b‚timents rÈsidentiels (mis en location ou non) qui s'engagent ‡ rÈaliser ce type de travaux.
L'accompagnement sera basÈ sur un engagement volontaire des propriÈtaires.
Les rÙles de cette nouvelle entitÈ comprendront entre-autres :
- l'identification des b‚timents rÈsidentiels ‡ faible performance ÈnergÈtique (sur base de niveaux de performance dÈfinis au niveau national) (sur base de CPE);
- l'Ètablissement d'une typologie nationale/locale des b‚timents rÈsidentiels ciblÈs, afin de standardiser et simplifier l'identification des potentiels et des mesures ‡ mettre en oeuvre, avec un accent sur la rÈnovation ÈnergÈtique profonde;

Pour 2022 et 2023, en raison de la crise ÈnergÈtique, il est fixÈ ‡ 8,00%, l'article de la loi stipulant que: ""Les opÈrateurs mettant ‡ la consommation de líessence et du gasoil routier doivent justifier de líutilisation de biocarburants, au sens de la directive (UE) 2018/2001 relative ‡ la promotion de líutilisation de líÈnergie produite ‡ partir de sources renouvelables, qui respectent les critËres de durabilitÈ y prÈvus, ‡ raison díau moins 8,00%, calculÈ sur base de la teneur ÈnergÈtique des carburants. LíÈlectricitÈ renouvelable mis ‡ la consommation pour la mobilitÈ Èlectrique par les opÈrateurs sur leurs stations-services peut Ítre comptabilisÈe suivant les dispositions de la directive (UE) 2018/2001. La part díÈnergie des biocarburants produits ‡ partir de cÈrÈales et díautres plantes riches en amidon, sucriËres et olÈagineuses, et ‡ partir de cultures cultivÈes en tant que cultures principales essentiellement ‡ des fins de production díÈnergie sur des terres agricoles, ne doit pas dÈpasser 5 % des biocarburants mis ‡ la consommation, calculÈ sur base de la teneur ÈnergÈtique des carburants.""  ¿ compter du 31 dÈcembre 2023 et jusqu'au 31 dÈcembre 2030 au plus tard, la limite des biocarburants, bioliquides et combustibles issus de la biomasse prÈsentant un risque ÈlevÈ d'induire des changements indirects dans l'affectation des sols et dont la zone de production gagne nettement sur les terres prÈsentant un important stock de carbone, doit diminuer progressivement pour s'Ètablir ‡ 0 % fin 2030.  La contribution des biocarburants avancÈs et du biogaz produits ‡ partir des matiËres premiËres ÈnumÈrÈes ‡ l'annexe IX, partie A de la directive 2018/2001, comme part de la consommation finale d'Ènergie dans le secteur des transports est d'au moins 0,2 % en 2022 et d'au moins 1 % en 2025 et d'au moins 3,5 % en 2030. La dÈcarbonation du secteur des transports joue un rÙle essentiel en vue de la rÈduction des Èmissions de gaz ‡ effet de serre ‡ líhorizon 2030 et en vue de la dÈcarbonation complËte pour 2050. 
Le Luxembourg vise díici pour le secteur des transports une part díÈnergies renouvelables díau moins 25 %, suivant le scÈnario du PNEC initial qui tient compte des multiplicateurs pour l'ÈlectromobilitÈ et les biocarburants dits de ""double-comptage"", díun cÙtÈ gr‚ce ‡ líincorporation des biocarburants qui demeurent nÈcessaires jusquíau remplacement complet du moteur thermique. Il faut prÈciser, que dÈj‡ dans le plan national intÈgrÈ Ènergie et climat, líambition Ètait nettement supÈrieure aux 14 % prÈvus par la refonte de la directive relative ‡ la promotion de l'utilisation de l'Ènergie produite ‡ partir de sources renouvelables. Enfin, le Luxembourg a Ègalement instaurÈ une limite de 5 % pour líutilisation de biocarburants de premiËre gÈnÈration, afin de promouvoir líutilisation de biocarburants de deuxiËme gÈnÈration considÈrÈs comme plus durables. A cÙtÈ des biocarburants, líapport díÈlectricitÈ renouvelable dans le secteur des transports est un atout majeur et les efforts tous azimuts pointent ‡ relever considÈrablement le pourcentage des voitures Èlectriques dans le parc automobile avec XX% díici 2030. Le secteur des transports reste un grand consommateur díÈnergie, de sorte que la diminution de la consommation de carburants fossiles est incontournable pour respecter les diffÈrents objectifs, tant pour la part díÈnergies renouvelables et la rÈduction des Èmissions de gaz ‡ effet de serre.  A cÙtÈ des biocarburants et líÈlectrification, líhydrogËne renouvelable jouera un rÙle important pour les moyens de transports ne se prÍtant pas ‡ líÈlectrification. Plus de dÈtails se trouvent dans la mesure sur la stratÈgie hydrogËne. Les mesures pour dÈcarboner le secteur des transports sont multiples et il ne suffira pas de remplacer un vecteur ÈnergÈtique par un autre, mais passera Ègalement via des mesures visant ‡ diminuer le recours au moyen de transport individuel en continuant de promouvoir la mobilitÈ douce et les transports en commun."

Luxembourg,"Depuis le 1er janvier 2007, les Èmissions de CO2 sont prises en compte dans le calcul de la taxe sur les vÈhicules routiers. Pour les vÈhicules immatriculÈs ‡ partir du 1er janvier 2001, le calcul se base sur les Èmissions de CO2 (valeur NEDC, valeur combinÈe) ainsi que le carburant utilisÈ. Pour les vÈhicules immatriculÈs pour la premiËre fois ‡ partir du 1er janvier 2021, le calcul se base sur la valeur WLTP des Èmissions de CO2 (valeur combinÈe) ainsi que le carburant utilisÈ."
Luxembourg,"Actuellement, au Luxembourg, la taxe d'immatriculation d'un vÈhicule ne sert quí‡ financer la t‚che administrative de l'immatriculation par la SNCA. Plusieurs Etats membres, dont la France et la SuËde, appliquent une taxe de premiËre immatriculation qui dÈpend des Èmissions de CO2 du vÈhicule et qui peut Ítre nÈgative ou positive. LíexpÈrience montre que ce systËme parvient ‡ encoura-ger fortement l'immatriculation de nouvelles voitures ‡ zÈro Èmissions, tout en restant budgÈtairement neutre.
L'opportunitÈ de rÈviser le systËme díimmatriculation sur base des rÈgimes existant dans díautres Etats membres, en vue d'une mise en oeuvre Èven-tuelle ‡ partir de 2025, sera ÈtudiÈe. En rendant les vÈhicules ‡ zÈro Èmission de roulement de CO2 plus attractifs par rapport aux vÈhicules propulsÈs par des moteurs ‡ combustion, un tel instrument fiscal pourrait accÈlÈrer davantage la transition vers des vÈhicules ‡ zÈro Èmission de roulement de CO2 avant líentrÈe en vigueur, en 2035, de l'interdiction de mise sur le marchÈ de nou-veaux vÈhicules propulsÈs ‡ carburant fossile dans l'UE. Afin d'assurer la viabili-tÈ budgÈtaire ‡ long terme du systËme, il conviendrait, lorsque l'Èlectrification du parc automobile sera plus avancÈe, de rÈflÈchir ‡ une taxation sÈlective des vÈhicules Èlectriques en tenant compte de critËres environnementaux et so-ciaux."
Luxembourg,"Pour tout nouveau contrat de leasing conclu depuis le 1er janvier 2017, líavantage en nature est calculÈ en fonction du type de motorisation (essence, diesel, Èlectrique) et des Èmissions de CO2 de la voiture de fonction. Il est ÈchelonnÈ de sorte que les voitures ‡ faibles Èmissions de CO2 (BEV ou PHEV) sont favorisÈes par rapport aux voitures ‡ essence ou diesel. Les voitures ‡ zÈro Èmissions de roulement (BEV et FECV) profitent d'un taux trËs avantageux. Les voitures ‡ motorisation diesel sont pÈnalisÈes par rapport aux autres motorisations. Pour toute voiture immatriculÈe depuis le 1er janvier 2021, líavantage en nature est par ailleurs calculÈ en fonction des valeurs WLTP (au lieu des valeurs NEDC).
A partir de 2023, le taux sera augmentÈ de +0,2% pour la majoritÈ des catÈgo-ries de voitures dont les Èmissions de CO2 dÈpassent 80 g/km. Pour les voi-tures dont les Èmissions de CO2 sont infÈrieures ou Ègales ‡ 80 g/km, il níy aura pas díadaptation des taux actuellement applicables. Le taux maximal de 1,8% síappliquera aux voitures dont les Èmissions de CO2 sont supÈrieures ‡ 130 g/km (actuellement 150 g/km). Pour les voitures de fonction nouvellement immatriculÈes ‡ partir du 1er janvier 2025 et pour lesquelles aucun contrat ne sera signÈ avant le 31 dÈcembre 2024, le rÈgime forfaitaire sera simplifiÈ et particuliËrement favorable aux voitures ‡ zÈro Èmission de roulement en CO2."
Luxembourg,"La voiture 100% Èlectrique est aujourdíhui un instrument efficace et ÈprouvÈ afin de rÈduire líempreinte carbone de la mobilitÈ Single motorisÈe. Líoffre de modËles de voitures Èlectriques pures continue de síagrandir, mais la diffÈrence du prix díacquisition díun tel vÈhicule par rapport ‡ une voiture thermique reste importante. MÍme si les rÈgimes díaides existants, allant jusquí‡ 8.000 euros, arrivent en partie de combler cette diffÈrence, un grand nombre de mÈnages dÈfavorisÈs ne sont pas en mesure díacquÈrir une voiture 100% Èlectrique. Dans líobjectif de faciliter le financement díun tel vÈhicule pour les foyers les plus dÈfavorisÈs, un systËme de leasing social pour des con-trats de leasing de longue durÈe sera ÈtudiÈ.

Luxembourg,"Les rÈductions de vitesse du trafic motorisÈ ont fait leur preuve, tant du point de vue de la sÈcuritÈ routiËre que des nuisances sonores et des Èmissions de particules fines et ‡ effet de serre. Si, aux heures de pointe, la congestion routiËre a pour effet de rÈduire la vitesse effective en-deÁ‡ des vitesses maximales autorisÈes, celles-ci, combinÈes ‡ des amÈnagements de líespace routier et ‡ des contrÙles policiers, ont un effet certain sur les vitesses pratiquÈes en situation non congestionnÈe.
Sur le rÈseau autoroutier, une limitation ‡ 90 km/h est dÈj‡ en place dans les tunnels. Sur certains tronÁons de líautoroute A6, une limitation ‡ 90km/h aux heures de pointe a eu un effet bÈnÈfique sur la sÈcuritÈ routiËre et la fluiditÈ du trafic. Cette pratique, rÈpandue sur les autoroutes de type pÈriurbain, qui sont caractÈrisÈes non seulement par des charges de trafic importantes, mais aussi par líinter-distance trËs faible entre les Èchangeurs et une sensibilitÈ des riverains aux nuisances sonores, devrait Ítre testÈe sur díautres secteurs du rÈseau autoroutier, en particulier le contournement de la ville de Luxembourg.
En rËgle gÈnÈrale, les limitations de vitesse doivent Ítre comprÈhensibles pour les conducteurs et doivent pouvoir Ítre contrÙlÈes par les forces de líordre, sinon elles níont pas le rÈsultat escomptÈ.
Ces principes, qui sont prÈfÈrables ‡ des limitations de vitesse gÈnÈralisÈes, valent tant hors localitÈ quíen milieu urbain. 
En milieu urbain, la grande majoritÈ des routes au Grand-duchÈ sont dÈj‡ limitÈes ‡ 30 km/h, voire mÍme ponctuellement ‡ 20 km/h. Il síagit avant tout de voiries communales dans les quartiers rÈsidentiels, qui níont pas vocation ‡ porter du trafic de transit. Depuis 2015, des limitations ‡ 30 km/h sont Ègalement permis sur des tronÁons de routes Ètatiques en localitÈ. Il est cependant essentiel que ces tronÁons, comme díailleurs toutes les zones dites apaisÈes, soient amÈnagÈes en consÈquence par la commune. Dans ces zones, le conducteur díun vÈhicule motorisÈ devrait avoir líimpression de níÍtre que visiteur dans un espace urbain qui est surtout destinÈ ‡ la vie de quartier ou de la localitÈ. Des amÈnagements physiques de la chaussÈe, et notamment des rÈtrÈcissements ou des surÈlÈvations, contraignent le conducteur ‡ rÈduire sa vitesse. La classification du rÈseau routier telle que prÈconisÈe par le Plan National de MobilitÈ 2035 distingue entre les routes qui ont vocation ‡ porter des charges de trafic importantes (appelÈes routes de liaison), celles qui portent un trËs faible trafic de transit et qui ont surtout un caractËre local (appelÈes routes de distribution) et celles qui ne servent quí‡ la desserte locale du quartier lui-mÍme. Sur les premiËres, en gÈnÈral Ètatiques, des limitations ‡ 30 km/h restent possibles sur des tronÁons de quelque 200 mËtres au niveau de centralitÈs ou díÈcoles. A la demande des communes et sous condition quíelles les rÈamÈnagent en consÈquence, les routes de distribution Ètatiques pourront Ítre apaisÈes sur des sections bien plus longues. Enfin, les rues de desserte locale sont en gÈnÈral dÈj‡ apaisÈes.
Avec cette approche pragmatique, qui ne se limite pas ‡ rÈduire les vitesses affichÈes sur les panneaux de circulation, mais qui vise ‡ rÈduire les vitesses rÈellement pratiquÈes par les conducteurs, le gouvernement apporte sa contribution ‡ la sÈcuritÈ routiËre et ‡ la limitation des gaz ‡ effets de serre liÈs ‡ des vitesses excessives de vÈhicules ‡ moteur thermique."
