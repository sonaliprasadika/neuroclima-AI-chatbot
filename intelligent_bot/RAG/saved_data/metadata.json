        "document": "United Kingdom: The UK's NDC covers all sectors and gases. For CO2, CH4 and N2O the reference year is 1990 and for F-gases the reference year is 1995. The UKs overall absolute target is to reduce GHG emissions at least by 68% (including LULUCF) by 2030 compared with reference levels. Emissions from International Aviation and Shipping are not included.\nThe UK has a policy framework in force establishing the binding commitment of net zero emissions by 2050, and Scotland sets bolder goals to reach net-zero in 2045 and 75% below 1990 by 2030. Wales pledges at least 80% reduction by 2050. \nThe Climate Change Act introduced carbon budgets for the UK Government, which cap emissions over successive five-year periods and must be set 12 years in advance.\nThe UK government is putting into force the Clean Growth Strategy, which is a Ten Point Plan for a green industrial revolution, encompassing clean energy, buildings, transport and technologies. Moreover, the government pushes for individual plans across key sectors such as Energy White Paper, Transport Decarbonisation Plan and Heat and Buildings Strategy (UK NDC, 2020).\nUKs NDC establishes a reduction of 68% of 1990 levels including LULUCF emissions. If LULUCF is excluded, this is equivalent to 69% or 251 MtCO2e. CAT classifies this as strong target and once the UK adopts national policies (2030 ban on the sale of fossil fuel cars and a ramping up of renewable energy investment, particularly into offshore wind) it will bring their emissions in line with the 1.5°C goal. Also, the UK has a net-zero goal by 2050. CAT cannot rate, at this moment, the UK target due to complexities derived from Brexit (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).\n ",

To help ensure the delivery of these targets, this part of the Act also requires that the Scottish Ministers set annual targets, in secondary legislation, for Scottish emissions from 2010 to 2050. Part 2 of the Act contains provisions which allow Scottish Ministers to establish a Scottish Committee on Climate Change, or to designate an existing body to exercise advisory functions, should it be decided that this is appropriate.\nPart 3 places duties on Scottish Ministers requiring that they report regularly to the Scottish Parliament on Scotland's emissions and on the progress being made towards meeting the emissions reduction targets set in the Act. Part 4 places climate change duties on Scottish public bodies. This part also contains powers to enable the Scottish Ministers, by order, to impose further duties on public bodies in relation to climate change. Part 5 includes provisions on climate change including adaptation, forestry, energy efficiency and waste reduction. Part 6 relates to public engagement and includes provision on carbon assessment.",

        "document": "United Kingdom: The UK resubmitted its 2020 NDC target in 2022. Its latest NDC, however, provides more detail on additional information that improves transparency around the UK's decarbonization plans.\nThe UK's NDC covers all sectors and gases. For CO2, CH4 and N2O the reference year is 1990 and for F-gases the reference year is 1995. The UKs overall absolute target is to reduce GHG emissions at least by 68% (including LULUCF) by 2030 compared with reference levels. Emissions from International Aviation and Shipping are not included.\nThe UK has a policy framework in force establishing the binding commitment of net zero emissions by 2050, and Scotland sets bolder goals to reach net-zero in 2045 and 75% below 1990 by 2030. Wales pledges at least 80% reduction by 2050. \nThe Climate Change Act introduced carbon budgets for the UK Government, which cap emissions over successive five-year periods and must be set 12 years in advance.\nThe UK government is putting into force the Clean Growth Strategy, which is a Ten Point Plan for a green industrial revolution, encompassing clean energy, buildings, transport and technologies. Moreover, the government pushes for individual plans across key sectors such as Energy White Paper, Transport Decarbonisation Plan and Heat and Buildings Strategy (UK NDC, 2020).\nUKs NDC establishes a reduction of 68% of 1990 levels including LULUCF emissions. If LULUCF is excluded, this is equivalent to 69% or 251 MtCO2e. CAT classifies this as strong target and once the UK adopts national policies (2030 ban on the sale of fossil fuel cars and a ramping up of renewable energy investment, particularly into offshore wind) it will bring their emissions in line with the 1.5°C goal. Also, the UK has a net-zero goal by 2050. CAT cannot rate, at this moment, the UK target due to complexities derived from Brexit (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).\n ",

The CPF taxes fossil fuels used to generate electricity via Carbon Price Support rates set under the Climate Change Levy. The price floor consists of two components which are paid for by energy generators in two different ways: (i) The EU ETS allowance price; and (ii) the Carbon Support Price (CPS), which tops up the EU ETS allowance prices, as projected by the Government, to the carbon floor price target.\nAt Budget 2014 the Government announced that the CPS component of the floor price would be capped at a maximum of £18/tCO2 from 2016 to 2020 to limit the competitive disadvantage faced by business and reduce energy bills for consumers. This price freeze was extended to 2021 in Budget 2016.",

In this submission, Norway committed to a reduction of at least 50% and towards 55% compared to 1990 levels by 2030 (52 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF). Norway will implement its NDC jointly with the EU and Iceland, nevertheless it intends to go beyond the EU in the target of 40%, using voluntary collaboration under Article 6 of Paris Agreement.\nEconomic measures like CO2- taxes and emission trading are central to Norwegian climate policy, but also CCS technologies, electric vehicles and renewable energy will be supported. The following policy instruments are outlined: the EU-ETS; Effort Sharing Regulation (ERS), regulating carbon emissions that fall outside EU-ETS, whereby the Norwegian binding target is to reduce emissions by 40% in 2030 compared with 2005; and LULUCF, which is ought to reach net zero by 2030 (Norway NDC, 2020).\nCAT evaluates Norways updated NDC as a progress but still insufficient to reach Paris Agreement goals. The present target establishes a reduction of at least 50% relative to 1990 levels by 2030, aiming for 55% (47  52% excluding LULUCF according to CAT). In CAT analysis, this new NDC will result in emissions between 24.6 and 27.2 MtCO2e in 2030, falling in a range warming that may reach between 2 and 3 degrees (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).",

New measures to increase financial support for offshore wind will also be considered.\nIntroducing payment schemes to support the production of renewable heat and small-scale clean electricity generation by households, industry, businesses and communities.\nNew guaranteed payments will be provided through feed-in tariff schemes from 2010 onwards, and a Renewable Heat Incentive from 2011 onwards. Before the schemes take effect, GBP 45 million in grants have been committed.\nThe Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation will be amended or replaced, taking into account sustainability issues, to ensure transport fuels contain a rising amount of renewable biofuels.",

Under HHCRO, obligated suppliers must mainly promote measures which improve the ability of low income, fuel poor and vulnerable households to heat their homes. This includes actions that result in heating savings, such as the replacement of a broken heating system or the upgrade of an inefficient heating system. Under ECO2, which ran from 1 April 2017 to 30 September 2018, suppliers were also required to deliver against an additional obligation called the Carbon Emissions Reduction Obligation (CERO).

St. 21 (2011-2012). This document reinforces the targets set out in the 2008 agreement on climate policy on transportation; construction; agriculture and carbon uptake by forests; and mainland industry and petroleum activities. Some of the core measures the document recommends to be adopted within these areas include:\n Create a climate and energy fund for development of technology and industrial transformation;\n Increase the offshore supply of electric power from the mainland, while safeguarding biological diversity;\n Increase state subsidies for investment in, and operation of, municipal public transportation and other environmentally-friendly forms of transportation;\n Adopt climate measures in agriculture and carbon removals in forests through active forest management;\n Maintain or increase the forest carbon stock through active, sustainable forest policies;\n Improve incentives for the use of bio-energy derived from wood (with emphasis on forest residues);\n Increase the mandatory sale of bio-fuels to 5%;\n Tighten the energy requirements in the building code to passive house level in 2015 and nearly zero energy level in 2020.\nThe settlement includes three main targets:\n In relation to the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, Norway plans to exceed its commitment by 10%\n Norway plans to become carbon neutral by 2050. However, if an ambitious global climate agreement is entered into through which other industrialised countries commit to undertake large reductions in GHG emissions, Norway will bring forward this target to 2030\n By 2020 Norway plans to commit to reducing its GHG emissions to an equivalent of 30% of the 1990 emissions level (and up to 40% contingent on global action)\nWhile emissions reductions can be carried out in Norway or abroad, the paper states that Norway will have a domestic reduction goal of two-thirds of GHG emissions.",

The system is based on the recommendations of the commission of experts appointed to devise an emissions trading system, although final decisions have not been made on all the issues discussed by the commission. As a general rule, the emissions quotas should be sold, but in order to avoid carbon leakage, it may be necessary to provide quotas free of charge for some industries for a limited period of time.

Industrial CO2 emitters are allocated a total amount of emissions, and reducing emissions generates credits which can be sold to other emitters needing more. The Scheme covered CO2 emissions from energy use and some industrial processes, and only covered installations not subject to the CO2 Tax (see separate entry) or special agreements on emissions reductions with the State Pollution Control Authority. According to this agreement, existing process industry plants agreed to commit themselves to a 20% reduction in all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2007, compared to 1990 levels.
