The new renewable energy law establishes more ambitious national renewable energy targets that should reach 20% of total national energy consumption and 40% of total electricity consumption by 2020. Moreover, 20% of energy used in heating and cooling and 10% of energy used in transportation have to come from renewable sources.

Existing remuneration of individual residents in areas where renewable energy projects are running have been amended and replaced by a credit on electricity bills.

Still, RE projects are not granted grid priority access as grid connection will be established on a first-come first served basis until the network is saturated.

Argentina,"This new resolution will display CO2 emission levels as well as the fuel consumption of light vehicles. In addition, the regulation establishes that manufacturers and importers of light motor vehicles must display in their showrooms and points of sale all vehicle models on the market with this comparative label removable or permanent in sight and another in the on-board bibliography.
The categories that will be applied to the comparative labels of each group of models will be defined based on CO2 emissions g/km and contemplating six levels identified by letters: A+, A, B, C, D and E. A + will represent the most efficient and with the lowest CO2 emission, while the E will be the least efficient and with the highest CO2 emission.
This resolution is effective as of the 17th of May 2022","The new resolution mandates the display of CO2 emission levels and fuel consumption for light vehicles. Manufacturers and importers must showcase all vehicle models with a comparative label in showrooms and points of sale, which can be either removable or permanent.
