      "  - actual output: The Vehicle Pollution Tax provides feedback to consumers by creating a financial incentive to choose cleaner vehicles, such as electric vehicles (EVs), over traditional fossil-fuel cars. By offering reduced parking fees for EV ownersâup to 50% less than what fossil-fuel vehicle owners payâmunicipalities encourage consumers to transition to environmentally friendly options. Additionally, the funding support from the Office for Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV) for chargepoints reinforces this shift by making the initial investment in EV infrastructure more affordable.\n",
