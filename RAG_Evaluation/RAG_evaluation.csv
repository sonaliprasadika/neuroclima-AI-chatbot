1. **Deforestation**: This is the process of clearing forests or trees, often for agricultural expansion, urban development, or logging. When trees are cut down, the carbon stored in their biomass is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO2), a potent greenhouse gas.

2. **Carbon Emissions**: When forests are removed, not only is the carbon stored in the trees released, but the capacity of the land to absorb CO2 (carbon uptake) is also diminished. This results in increased net carbon emissions, contributing to climate change.
